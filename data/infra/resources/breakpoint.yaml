resource_description_list:
- markdown: Use the **breakpoint** resource to add breakpoints to recipes. Run the
    chef-shell in Chef Infra Client mode, and then use those breakpoints to debug
    recipes. Breakpoints are ignored by the chef-client during an actual chef-client
    run. That said, breakpoints are typically used to debug recipes only when running
    them in a non-production environment, after which they are removed from those
    recipes before the parent cookbook is uploaded to the Chef server.

  **A recipe without a breakpoint**

  ```ruby
  yum_key node['yum']['elrepo']['key'] do
    url  node['yum']['elrepo']['key_url']
    action :add
  end

  yum_repository 'elrepo' do
    description 'ELRepo.org Community Enterprise Linux Extras Repository'
    key node['yum']['elrepo']['key']
    mirrorlist node['yum']['elrepo']['url']
    includepkgs node['yum']['elrepo']['includepkgs']
    exclude node['yum']['elrepo']['exclude']
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **The same recipe with breakpoints**

  In the following example, the name of each breakpoint is an arbitrary string.

  ```ruby
  breakpoint "before yum_key node['yum']['repo_name']['key']" do
    action :break
  end

  yum_key node['yum']['repo_name']['key'] do
    url  node['yum']['repo_name']['key_url']
    action :add
  end

  breakpoint "after yum_key node['yum']['repo_name']['key']" do
    action :break
  end

  breakpoint "before yum_repository 'repo_name'" do
    action :break
  end

  yum_repository 'repo_name' do
    description 'description'
    key node['yum']['repo_name']['key']
    mirrorlist node['yum']['repo_name']['url']
    includepkgs node['yum']['repo_name']['includepkgs']
    exclude node['yum']['repo_name']['exclude']
    action :create
  end

  breakpoint "after yum_repository 'repo_name'" do
    action :break
  end
  ```

  In the previous examples, the names are used to indicate if the breakpoint is before or after a resource and also to specify which resource it is before or after.
