    Many DSC resources are comparable to built-in Chef Infra Client resources. For example, both DSC and Chef Infra Client
    have file, package, and service resources. The dsc_script resource is most useful for those DSC resources that do not have a direct comparison to a
    resource in Chef Infra Client, such as the Archive resource, a custom DSC resource, an existing DSC script that performs an important
    task, and so on. Use the dsc_script resource to embed the code that defines a DSC configuration directly within a Chef Infra Client recipe.
- warning:
    markdown: The **dsc_script** resource is only available on 64-bit Chef Infra Client.
