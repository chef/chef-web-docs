- markdown: 'Use the **windows_env** resource to manage environment keys in

    Microsoft Windows. After an environment key is set, Microsoft Windows

    must be restarted before the environment key will be available to the

    Task Scheduler.


    This resource was previously called the **env** resource; its name was

    updated in Chef Client 14.0 to reflect the fact that only Windows is

    supported. Existing cookbooks using `env` will continue to function, but

    should be updated to use the new name.'
- note:
    markdown: 'On UNIX-based systems, the best way to manipulate environment keys
      is

      with the `ENV` variable in Ruby; however, this approach does not have

      the same permanent effect as using the **windows_env** resource.'
