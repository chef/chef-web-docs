- markdown: |-
    Use the **gem_package** resource to manage gem packages that are only included in recipes.
    When a gem is installed from a local file, it must be added to the node using the **remote_file** or **cookbook_file** resources.
- note:
    markdown: The **gem_package** resource must be specified as `gem_package` and
      cannot be shortened to `package` in a recipe.
- warning:
    markdown: |-
      The **chef_gem** and **gem_package** resources are both used to install Ruby gems. For any machine on which Chef Infra Client is
      installed, there are two instances of Ruby. One is the standard, system-wide instance of Ruby and the other is a dedicated instance that is
      available only to Chef Infra Client.
      Use the **chef_gem** resource to install gems into the instance of Ruby that is dedicated to Chef Infra Client.
      Use the **gem_package** resource to install all other gems (i.e. install gems system-wide).

actions_list:
  :install:
    markdown: Default. Install a package. If a version is specified, install the specified
      version of the package.
  :nothing:
    shortcode: resources_common_actions_nothing.md
  :purge:
    markdown: Purge a package. This action typically removes the configuration files
      as well as the package.
  :reconfig:
    markdown: Reconfigure a package. This action requires a response file.
  :remove:
    markdown: Remove a package.
  :upgrade:
    markdown: Install a package and/or ensure that a package is the latest version.
properties_list:
- property: clear_sources

  required: false
  default_value: 'false'
  description_list:
  - markdown: Set to `true` to download a gem from the path specified by the `source`
      property (and not from RubyGems).
- property: gem_binary
  ruby_type: String
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: The path of a gem binary to use for the installation. By default, the
      same version of Ruby that is used by Chef Infra Client will be used.
- property: include_default_source
  ruby_type: true, false
  required: false
  new_in: '13.0'
  description_list:
  - markdown: Set to `false` to not include `Chef::Config[:rubygems_url]` in the sources.
- property: options
  ruby_type: String, Hash, Array
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: Options for the gem install, either a Hash or a String. When a hash
      is given, the options are passed to `Gem::DependencyInstaller.new`, and the
      gem will be installed via the gems API. When a String is given, the gem will
      be installed by shelling out to the gem command. Using a Hash of options with
      an explicit gem_binary will result in undefined behavior.
- property: package_name
  ruby_type: String
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: An optional property to set the package name if it differs from the
      resource block's name.
- property: source
  ruby_type: String, Array
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: Optional. The URL, or list of URLs, at which the gem package is located.
      This list is added to the source configured in `Chef::Config[:rubygems_url]`
      (see also include_default_source) to construct the complete list of rubygems
      sources. Users in an 'airgapped' environment should set Chef::Config[:rubygems_url]
      to their local RubyGems mirror.
- property: timeout
  ruby_type: String, Integer
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out.
- property: version
  ruby_type: String
  required: false
  description_list:
  - markdown: The version of a package to be installed or upgraded.
examples: |
  The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using the **gem_package** resource in recipes:

  **Install a gem file from the local file system**

  ```ruby
  gem_package 'loofah' do
    source '/tmp/loofah-2.7.0.gem'
    action :install
  end
  ```

  **Use the `ignore_failure` common attribute**

  ```ruby
  gem_package 'syntax' do
    action :install
    ignore_failure true
  end
  ```
