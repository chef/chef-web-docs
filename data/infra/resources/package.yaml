    Use the **package** resource to manage packages. When the package is installed from a local file (such as with RubyGems, dpkg, or RPM Package Manager), the file must be added to the node using the remote_file or cookbook_file resources.

    This resource is the base resource for several other resources used for package management on specific platforms. While it is possible to use each of these specific resources, it is recommended to use the package resource as often as possible.
