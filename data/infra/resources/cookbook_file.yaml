      permissions and content of the symlink''s target file.

- property: mode
  ruby_type: Integer, String

  description_list:
  - markdown: 'If `mode` is not specified and if the file already exists, the

      existing mode on the file is used. If `mode` is not specified, the

      file does not exist, and the `:create` action is specified, Chef

      Infra Client assumes a mask value of `''0777''` and then applies the

      umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the

      `mask` value. For example, if the umask on a system is `''022''`, Chef

      Infra Client uses the default value of `''0755''`.


      The behavior is different depending on the platform.


      UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that

      defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:

      `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted

      string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If

      the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the

      value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For

      example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,

      use `''0777''` or `''777''`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,

      use `01777` or `''1777''`.


      Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the

      octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows

      security. For example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. Values up to

      `''0777''` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft

      Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`

      equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This

      property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no

      effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both

      specified, the effects are cumulative.'

  Transfer a file\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file 'file.txt' do\n  \
  \  mode '0755'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Handle cookbook_file and package resources in\
  \ the same recipe\n\n  When a **cookbook_file** resource and a **package** resource\
  \ are both\n  called from within the same recipe, use the `flush_cache` attribute\
  \ to\n  dump the in-memory Yum cache, and then use the repository immediately to\n\
  \  ensure that the correct package is installed:\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file\
  \ '/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo' do\n    source 'custom'\n    mode '0755'\n  end\n\
  \n  package 'only-in-custom-repo' do\n    action :install\n    flush_cache [ :before\
  \ ]\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Install repositories from a file, trigger a command, and\
  \ force the\n  internal cache to reload\n\n  The following example shows how to\
  \ install new Yum repositories from a\n  file, where the installation of the repository\
  \ triggers a creation of\n  the Yum cache that forces the internal cache for Chef\
  \ Infra Client to\n  reload:\n\n  ```ruby\n  execute 'create-yum-cache' do\n  \
  \ command 'yum -q makecache'\n   action :nothing\n  end\n\n  ruby_block 'reload-internal-yum-cache'\
  \ do\n    block do\n      Chef::Provider::Package::Yum::YumCache.instance.reload\n\
  \    end\n    action :nothing\n  end\n\n  cookbook_file '/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo'\
  \ do\n    source 'custom'\n    mode '0755'\n    notifies :run, 'execute[create-yum-cache]',\
  \ :immediately\n    notifies :create, 'ruby_block[reload-internal-yum-cache]', :immediately\n\
  \  end\n  ```\n\n  Use a case statement\n\n  The following example shows how a case\
  \ statement can be used to handle a\n  situation where an application needs to be\
  \ installed on multiple\n  platforms, but where the install directories are different\
  \ paths,\n  depending on the platform:\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file 'application.pm'\
  \ do\n    path case node['platform']\n      when 'centos','redhat'\n        '/usr/lib/version/1.2.3/dir/application.pm'\n\
  \      when 'arch'\n        '/usr/share/version/core_version/dir/application.pm'\n\
  \      else\n        '/etc/version/dir/application.pm'\n      end\n    source \"\
  application-#{node['languages']['perl']['version']}.pm\"\n    owner 'root'\n   \
  \ group 'root'\n    mode '0755'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Manage dotfiles\n\n  The following\
  \ example shows using the **directory** and\n  **cookbook_file** resources to manage\
  \ dotfiles. The dotfiles are\n  defined by a JSON data structure similar to:\n\n\
  \  ```javascript\n  \"files\": {\n    \".zshrc\": {\n      \"mode\": '0755',\n\
  \      \"source\": \"dot-zshrc\"\n      },\n    \".bashrc\": {\n      \"mode\":\
  \ '0755',\n      \"source\": \"dot-bashrc\"\n       },\n    \".bash_profile\": {\n\
  \      \"mode\": '0755',\n      \"source\": \"dot-bash_profile\"\n      },\n   \
  \ }\n  ```\n\n  and then the following resources manage the dotfiles:\n\n  ```ruby\n\
  \  if u.has_key?('files')\n    u['files'].each do |filename, file_data|\n\n    directory\
  \ \"#{home_dir}/#{File.dirname(filename)}\" do\n      recursive true\n      mode\
  \ '0755'\n    end if file_data['subdir']\n\n    cookbook_file \"#{home_dir}/#{filename}\"\
  \ do\n      source \"#{u['id']}/#{file_data['source']}\"\n      owner 'u['id']'\n\
  \      group 'group_id'\n      mode 'file_data['mode']'\n      ignore_failure true\n\
  \      backup 0\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n"
