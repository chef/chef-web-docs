    Use the **cookbook_file** resource to transfer files from a sub-directory of COOKBOOK_NAME/files/ to a specified path located on a host that is running the Chef Infra Client. The file is selected according to file specificity, which allows different source files to be used based on the hostname, host platform (operating system, distro, or as appropriate), or platform version. Files that are located in the COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default sub-directory may be used on any platform.

    During a Chef Infra Client run, the checksum for each local file is calculated and then compared against the checksum for the same file as it currently exists in the cookbook on the Chef Infra Server. A file is not transferred when the checksums match. Only files that require an update are transferred from the Chef Infra Server to a node.

      existing mode on the file is used. If `mode` is not specified, the

      file does not exist, and the `:create` action is specified, Chef

      Infra Client assumes a mask value of `''0777''` and then applies the

      umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the

      `mask` value. For example, if the umask on a system is `''022''`, Chef

      Infra Client uses the default value of `''0755''`.


      The behavior is different depending on the platform.


      UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that

      defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:

      `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted

      string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If

      the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the

      value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For

      example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,

      use `''0777''` or `''777''`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,

      use `01777` or `''1777''`.


      Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the

      octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows

      security. For example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. Values up to

      `''0777''` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft

      Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`

      equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This

      property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no

      effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both

      specified, the effects are cumulative.'

  Transfer a file\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file 'file.txt' do\n  \
  \  mode '0755'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Handle cookbook_file and package resources in\
  \ the same recipe\n\n  When a **cookbook_file** resource and a **package** resource\
  \ are both\n  called from within the same recipe, use the `flush_cache` attribute\
  \ to\n  dump the in-memory Yum cache, and then use the repository immediately to\n\
  \  ensure that the correct package is installed:\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file\
  \ '/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo' do\n    source 'custom'\n    mode '0755'\n  end\n\
  \n  package 'only-in-custom-repo' do\n    action :install\n    flush_cache [ :before\
  \ ]\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Install repositories from a file, trigger a command, and\
  \ force the\n  internal cache to reload\n\n  The following example shows how to\
  \ install new Yum repositories from a\n  file, where the installation of the repository\
  \ triggers a creation of\n  the Yum cache that forces the internal cache for Chef\
  \ Infra Client to\n  reload:\n\n  ```ruby\n  execute 'create-yum-cache' do\n  \
  \ command 'yum -q makecache'\n   action :nothing\n  end\n\n  ruby_block 'reload-internal-yum-cache'\
  \ do\n    block do\n      Chef::Provider::Package::Yum::YumCache.instance.reload\n\
  \    end\n    action :nothing\n  end\n\n  cookbook_file '/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo'\
  \ do\n    source 'custom'\n    mode '0755'\n    notifies :run, 'execute[create-yum-cache]',\
  \ :immediately\n    notifies :create, 'ruby_block[reload-internal-yum-cache]', :immediately\n\
  \  end\n  ```\n\n  Use a case statement\n\n  The following example shows how a case\
  \ statement can be used to handle a\n  situation where an application needs to be\
  \ installed on multiple\n  platforms, but where the install directories are different\
  \ paths,\n  depending on the platform:\n\n  ```ruby\n  cookbook_file 'application.pm'\
  \ do\n    path case node['platform']\n      when 'centos','redhat'\n        '/usr/lib/version/1.2.3/dir/application.pm'\n\
  \      when 'arch'\n        '/usr/share/version/core_version/dir/application.pm'\n\
  \      else\n        '/etc/version/dir/application.pm'\n      end\n    source \"\
  application-#{node['languages']['perl']['version']}.pm\"\n    owner 'root'\n   \
  \ group 'root'\n    mode '0755'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Manage dotfiles\n\n  The following\
  \ example shows using the **directory** and\n  **cookbook_file** resources to manage\
  \ dotfiles. The dotfiles are\n  defined by a JSON data structure similar to:\n\n\
  \  ```javascript\n  \"files\": {\n    \".zshrc\": {\n      \"mode\": '0755',\n\
  \      \"source\": \"dot-zshrc\"\n      },\n    \".bashrc\": {\n      \"mode\":\
  \ '0755',\n      \"source\": \"dot-bashrc\"\n       },\n    \".bash_profile\": {\n\
  \      \"mode\": '0755',\n      \"source\": \"dot-bash_profile\"\n      },\n   \
  \ }\n  ```\n\n  and then the following resources manage the dotfiles:\n\n  ```ruby\n\
  \  if u.has_key?('files')\n    u['files'].each do |filename, file_data|\n\n    directory\
  \ \"#{home_dir}/#{File.dirname(filename)}\" do\n      recursive true\n      mode\
  \ '0755'\n    end if file_data['subdir']\n\n    cookbook_file \"#{home_dir}/#{filename}\"\
  \ do\n      source \"#{u['id']}/#{file_data['source']}\"\n      owner 'u['id']'\n\
  \      group 'group_id'\n      mode 'file_data['mode']'\n      ignore_failure true\n\
  \      backup 0\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n"
