- markdown: Use the **ksh** resource to execute scripts using the Korn shell (ksh)
    interpreter. This resource may also use any of the actions and properties that
    are available to the **execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this
    resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to
    the environment in which they are run. Use `not_if` and `only_if` to guard this
    resource for idempotence.
syntax_description: |
  A **ksh** resource block executes scripts using ksh:

  ```ruby
  ksh 'hello world' do
    code <<-EOH
      echo "Hello world!"
      echo "Current directory: " $cwd
    EOH
  end
  ```

  where:

  - `code` specifies the command to run.
