- markdown: Use the **directory** resource to manage a directory, which is a hierarchy
    of folders that comprises all of the information stored on a computer. The root
    directory is the top-level, under which the rest of the directory is organized.
    The directory resource uses the name property to specify the path to a location
    in a directory. Typically, permission to access that location in the directory
    is required.
