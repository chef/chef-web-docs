- markdown: 'Use the **link** resource to create symbolic or hard links.


    A symbolic link---sometimes referred to as a soft link---is a directory

    entry that associates a file name with a string that contains an

    absolute or relative path to a file on any file system. In other words,

    "a file that contains a path that points to another file." A symbolic

    link creates a new file with a new inode that points to the inode

    location of the original file.


    A hard link is a directory entry that associates a file with another

    file in the same file system. In other words, "multiple directory

    entries to the same file." A hard link creates a new file that points to

    the same inode as the original file. On Windows, this resource can be

    used to create directory junction/reparse points.'
syntax_description: "A **link** resource block creates symbolic or hard links. For\
  \ example,\nto create a hard link from `/tmp/file` to `/etc/file`:\n\n```ruby\n\
  link '/tmp/file' do\n  to '/etc/file'\n  link_type :hard\nend\n```\n\nBecause the\
  \ default value for `link_type` is symbolic, and because\nproperties that are not\
  \ specified in the resource block will be assigned\ntheir default values, the following\
  \ example creates a symbolic link:\n\n```ruby\nlink '/tmp/file' do\n  to '/etc/file'\n\

      file does not exist, and the `:create` action is specified, Chef

      Infra Client assumes a mask value of `''0777''` and then applies the

      umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the

      `mask` value. For example, if the umask on a system is `''022''`, Chef

      Infra Client uses the default value of `''0755''`.


      The behavior is different depending on the platform.


      UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that

      defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:

      `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted

      string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If

      the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the

      value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For

      example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,

      use `''0777''` or `''777''`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,

      use `01777` or `''1777''`.


      Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the

      octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows

      security. For example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. Values up to

      `''0777''` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft

      Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`

      equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This

      property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no

      effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both

      specified, the effects are cumulative.'

examples: "
  Create symbolic links\n\n  The following example will create a symbolic\
  \ link from `/tmp/file` to\n  `/etc/file`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  link '/tmp/file' do\n\
  \    to '/etc/file'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Create hard links\n\n  The following example\
  \ will create a hard link from `/tmp/file` to\n  `/etc/file`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  link\
  \ '/tmp/file' do\n    to '/etc/file'\n    link_type :hard\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Delete\
  \ links\n\n  The following example will delete the `/tmp/file` symbolic link and\
  \ uses\n  the `only_if` guard to run the `test -L` command, which verifies that\n\
  \  `/tmp/file` is a symbolic link, and then only deletes `/tmp/file` if the\n  test\
  \ passes:\n\n  ```ruby\n  link '/tmp/file' do\n    action :delete\n    only_if\
  \ 'test -L /tmp/file'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Create multiple symbolic links\n\n  The\
  \ following example creates symbolic links from two files in the\n  `/vol/webserver/cert/`\
  \ directory to files located in the\n  `/etc/ssl/certs/` directory:\n\n  ```ruby\n\
  \  link '/vol/webserver/cert/server.crt' do\n    to '/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-name.pem'\n\
  \  end\n\n  link '/vol/webserver/cert/server.key' do\n    to '/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-name.key'\n\
  \  end\n  ```\n\n  Create platform-specific symbolic links\n\n  The following example\
  \ shows installing a filter module on Apache. The\n  package name is different for\
  \ different platforms, and for the Red Hat\n  Enterprise Linux family, a symbolic\
  \ link is required:\n\n  ```ruby\n  include_recipe 'apache2::default'\n\n  case\
  \ node['platform_family']\n  when 'debian'\n    ...\n  when 'suse'\n    ...\n  when\
  \ 'rhel', 'fedora'\n    ...\n\n    link '/usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_apreq.so'\
  \ do\n      to      '/usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_apreq2.so'\n      only_if 'test\
  \ -f /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_apreq2.so'\n    end\n\n    link '/usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_apreq.so'\
  \ do\n      to      '/usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_apreq2.so'\n      only_if 'test\
  \ -f /usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_apreq2.so'\n    end\n  end\n\n  ...\n  ```\n\n \

  \n  **Create Windows junction/reparse points**\n\n  This example demonstrates how\
  \ to create a directory junction/reparse\n  point. In this example, `C:\\destination`\
  \ will be a junction/reparse\n  point to the `C:\\source` directory.\n\n  ```ruby\n\
  \  directory 'C:/source'\n\n  link 'C:/destination' do\n      link_type :symbolic\n\
  \      to 'C:/source'\n  end\n  ```\n"
