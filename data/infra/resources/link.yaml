    Use the **link** resource to create symbolic or hard links.

    A symbolic link—sometimes referred to as a soft link—is a directory entry that associates a file name with a string that contains an absolute or relative path to a file on any file system. In other words, 'a file that contains a path that points to another file.' A symbolic link creates a new file with a new inode that points to the inode location of the original file.

    A hard link is a directory entry that associates a file with another file in the same file system. In other words, 'multiple directory entries to the same file.' A hard link creates a new file that points to the same inode as the original file.
