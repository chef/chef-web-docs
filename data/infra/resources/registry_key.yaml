- note:
    markdown: |-
      64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows have a 32-bit compatibility layer in the registry that reflects and redirects certain keys (and their values) into specific locations (or logical views) of the registry hive.

      Chef Infra Client can access any reflected or redirected registry key. The machine architecture of the system on which Chef Infra Client is running is used as the default (non-redirected) location. Access to the SysWow64 location is redirected must be specified. Typically, this is only necessary to ensure compatibility with 32-bit applications that are running on a 64-bit operating system.

      For more information, see: [Registry Reflection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog64/registry-reflection).

  - markdown: 'The architecture of the node for which keys are to be created or

      deleted. Possible values: `:i386` (for nodes with a 32-bit

      registry), `:x86_64` (for nodes with a 64-bit registry), and

      `:machine` (to have Chef Infra Client determine the architecture

      during a Chef Infra Client run).


      In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines

      running Microsoft Windows, the `architecture` property must be set

      to `:i386`. The `:x86_64` value can be used to force writing to a

      64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the

      default (`:machine`) because Chef Infra Client returns an exception

      if `:x86_64` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit

      machine (whereas with `:machine`, Chef Infra Client is able to

      access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).'

examples: |
  **Create a registry key**

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\path-to-key\\Policies\\System' do
    values [{
      name: 'EnableLUA',
      type: :dword,
      data: 0
    }]
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **Create a registry key with binary data: "\x01\x02\x03"**:

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ChefTest' do
    values [{
      :name => "test",
      :type => :binary,
      :data => [0, 1, 2].map(&:chr).join
    }]
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **Create 32-bit key in redirected wow6432 tree**

  In 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Example is a re-directed key. In the following examples, because HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Example is a 32-bit key, the output will be �Found 32-bit key� if they are run on a version of Microsoft Windows that is 64-bit:

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Example' do
    architecture :i386
    recursive true
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **Set proxy settings to be the same as those used by #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT}**

  ```ruby
  proxy = URI.parse(Chef::Config[:http_proxy])
  registry_key 'HKCU\Software\Microsoft\path\to\key\Internet Settings' do
    values [{name: 'ProxyEnable', type: :reg_dword, data: 1},
            {name: 'ProxyServer', data: "#{proxy.host}:#{proxy.port}"},
            {name: 'ProxyOverride', type: :reg_string, data: <local>},
           ]
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **Set the name of a registry key to "(Default)"**

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'Set (Default) value' do
    key 'HKLM\Software\Test\Key\Path'
    values [
      {name: '', type: :string, data: 'test'},
    ]
    action :create
  end
  ```

  **Delete a registry key value**

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\path\to\key\AU' do
    values [{
      name: 'NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers',
      type: :dword,
      data: ''
      }]
    action :delete
  end
  ```

  Note: If data: is not specified, you get an error: Missing data key in RegistryKey values hash

  **Delete a registry key and its subkeys, recursively**

  ```ruby
  registry_key 'HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\path\to\key\Themes' do
    recursive true
    action :delete_key
  end
  ```

  Note: Be careful when using the :delete_key action with the recursive attribute. This will delete the registry key, all of its values and all of the names, types, and data associated with them. This cannot be undone by #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT}.
