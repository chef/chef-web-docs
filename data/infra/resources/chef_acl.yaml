      A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a resource[name], the :action that resource should take,
      and then the :timer for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a notifies statement for each resource to be notified.
      If the referenced resource does not exist, an error is raised. In contrast, subscribes will not fail if the source resource is not found.
      A timer specifies the point during a Chef Infra Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:'
  - shortcode: resources_common_notification_timers.md
  - markdown: |-
      :before
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

      :delayed
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

      :immediate, :immediately
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, for each resource notified.

  - markdown: |-
      A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a 'resource[name]', the :action to be taken, and then the :timer for that action.

      Note that subscribes does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

      ```ruby
      file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
      end
      ````

      service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
      end
      In this case the subscribes property reloads the nginx service whenever its certificate file, located under /etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt, is updated.
      Subscribes does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the :reload action for its resource (in this example nginx) when a change is detected.

      If the other resource does not exist, the subscription will not raise an error. Contrast this with the stricter semantics of notifies, which will raise an error if the other resource does not exist.
