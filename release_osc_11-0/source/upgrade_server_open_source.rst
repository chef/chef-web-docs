.. THIS PAGE DOCUMENTS Open Source Chef server version 11.0

=====================================================
Upgrade the |chef server osc| Server
=====================================================

The |chef server osc| server can be upgraded to newer versions of the |chef server| 11 release and also from |chef server| 10.

Upgrade to Newer Versions of |chef server_title| 11
======================================================
To upgrade to newer versions of the |chef server osc| server, do the following:

#. Go to http://www.chef.io/chef/install/.

#. Click the **Chef Server** tab.

#. Select the operating system, version, and architecture.

#. Select the version of |chef server| 11 to download, and then click the link that appears to download the package.

#. Install the downloaded package using the correct method for the operating system on which |chef server| 11 will be installed.

#. Configure |chef server| 11 by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   This command will set up all of the required components, including |erchef|, |rabbitmq|, and |postgresql|.

#. Restart |chef server| 11 by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ sudo chef-server-ctl restart


Upgrade from |chef server osc| 11.0.4 (or higher)
-----------------------------------------------------

.. note:: You may use this section for upgrading the |chef server osc| server. You may also use the steps described in the previous section, if you prefer.

.. warning:: This section applies only to upgrading standalone configurations of the |chef server osc| server.

The new upgrade process is simpler. Stop the services, update the package on the system, run the ``upgrade`` subcommand, and then restart the |chef server osc| server.

#. Stop the services:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl stop

#. After all of the services have shut down, update the package (using the appropriate package manager for the system on which the server is running):
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ dpkg -i package.deb

#. Upgrade the server itself:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl upgrade
   
   .. note:: The following error may be present in the logs for |postgresql| during the upgrade process: ``ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "checksums_pkey"``. This error does not represent an issue with the upgrade process and can be safely ignored.

#. Restart all of the services:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl restart

   Sometimes the upgrade process may orphan processes. If orphaned processes are discovered, they can be killed safely.

#. Check the status of everything:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl status


Upgrade to |chef server osc| 11.1.4 (or higher)
-----------------------------------------------------
.. warning:: This section applies only to upgrading standalone configurations of the |chef server osc| server.

The new upgrade process is simpler. Update the package on the system, and then run the ``upgrade`` subcommand:

#. After all of the services have shut down, update the package (using the appropriate package manager for the system on which the server is running):
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ dpkg -i package.deb

#. Upgrade the server itself:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl upgrade
   
   .. note:: The following error may be present in the logs for |postgresql| during the upgrade process: ``ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "checksums_pkey"``. This error does not represent an issue with the upgrade process and can be safely ignored.

#. Check the status of everything:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ chef-server-ctl status


Upgrade from |chef server osc| 10
=====================================================
Upgrading to |chef server| 11 from |chef server| 10 is a relatively simple process: install the |chef server| 11 and then move the data from |chef server| 10 to the new one. Because the |chef server| 10 database is |couch db| and the |chef server| 11 database is |postgresql|, the data cannot be moved directly. Instead, use the following |knife| subcommands:

* ``knife download``
* ``knife list``
* ``knife upload``

These subcommands will be used to download the data from |chef server| 10 (as |json|), and then upload it to the |chef server| 11 server. This approach bypasses the need to interact directly with either database or having to worry about how the data is stored in either location. 

.. note:: |chef client| version 10.x requires the ``knife-essentials`` plugin. To install the latest version of the ``knife-essentials`` plugin for |chef client| 10.x, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ gem install knife-essentials

   For more information about ``knife-essentials``, see https://github.com/jkeiser/knife-essentials. ``knife-essentials`` was added to |chef| starting with the 11.0 release.


Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------

* A live |chef server| 10 server
* A live |chef server| 11 server
* A workstation (running |knife|) that can access both the |chef server| 10 and |chef server| 11 servers
* The ability to run the ``knife download`` and ``knife upload`` subcommands

Set up |chef server_title| 10 Access 
-----------------------------------------------------
Use the following steps to configure a workstation so that it can communicate with the |chef server| 10 server:

#. Create a directory to use as the location to which data will be downloaded. This topic uses a directory named ``~/transfer``.

#. In the ``~/transfer`` directory, create a file named ``.chef/knife-chef10.rb``. The contents of this file should be similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      transfer_repo = File.expand_path('..', File.dirname(__FILE__))
      chef_server_url "http://chef-10.example.com:4000"
      node_name 'chef-webui'
      client_key "#{transfer_repo}/.chef/chef-webui.pem"
      repo_mode 'everything'
      versioned_cookbooks true
      chef_repo_path transfer_repo

   where ``chef_server_url`` is the URL for the |chef server| 10 server from which the data will be downloaded and ``node_name`` is the name of the workstation from which |knife| runs (with admin rights).

#. Copy the private key for the |chef server| 10 server to the ``.chef`` directory. The private key is typically located at ``/etc/chef/webui.pem``. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cp <local_webui.pem> .chef/chef-webui.pem

#. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife list /clients

   to return a list of all clients, including ``/clients/chef-webui.json`` and ``/clients/chef-validator.json``.


Download Data
-----------------------------------------------------
To download data from the |chef server| 10, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife download -c .chef/knife-chef10.rb /

This will transfer all of the data on |chef server| 10 to the transfer directory.


Set up |chef server_title| 11 Access 
-----------------------------------------------------
Use the following steps to configure a workstation so that it can communicate with the |chef server| 11 server:

#. In the same ``~/transfer`` directory, create a file named ``.chef/knife.rb``. The contents of this file should be similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      transfer_repo = File.expand_path('..', File.dirname(__FILE__))
      chef_server_url "https://chef-11.example.com"
      node_name 'admin'
      client_key "#{transfer_repo}/.chef/admin.pem"
      repo_mode 'everything'
      versioned_cookbooks true
      chef_repo_path transfer_repo

   where ``chef_server_url`` is the URL for the |chef server| 11 server to which the data will be uploaded.

#. Copy the private key for the |chef server| 11 server to the ``.chef`` directory. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cp <admin.pem> .chef/admin.pem

#. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife list /users

   to return a list of all users, including ``/users/admin.json``.


Update chef-validator settings
-----------------------------------------------------
The |chef validator| client is no longer special; |chef server| 11 requires the ``chef-validator`` flag to be set in order for the |chef validator| to be created. 

#. Edit the ``/clients/chef-validator.json`` file---located in the ``~/transfer`` directory---and add ``"validator": true`` as a property, like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "chef-validator",
     "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\
       nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AM235gKCgAQEA8l0+sy05G6YX/SaVsu2k\
       ndwOTIZKLhvfuhp/VcBU432455DTMWyxTR9sdgdRq+mgUqkF4ox/zIwhLG5nyHMLa\
       nFKsKPxUQlS1Jsf2gaoP+RhnswmspJffhF2l593DwSsglTLNtDw5cqhF6YYo7b7cB\
       nywHaWL+O3cSFLd0US7tSoOTeOdnAAwPwrsdfgKQdgfgerCV3Ottn83V8BUCfpnbi\
       nNetytGDnE1Ms9lvYswsW2EqEnzQ+afvlDq5tXu72b1XBs7Y/8JqQz8+3lVHNGKys\
       nh5U6VdI5Br0u1leO0LcffgrgE4@#$fs7/T2MVztXujUN9CoX1a+3siu3HAa8lslo\
       noQIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
     "_rev": "1-72a9f16a92108bd794704c075261aeb5",
     "validator": true
   }

#. #. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife list /clients

   to return a list of all clients, including ``/clients/chef-validator.json``.


Verify the admin public key
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``admin.pem`` private key must be correct for each workstation that will have access to |chef server| 11. |chef server| 11 has a new user named ``admin``, whereas many instances of |chef server| 10 have an admin client named ``admin``. For |chef server| 11, |knife| requires a private key named ``admin.pem``. This naming similarity can be an issue if the name of the client doesn't match the name of the private key.

#. Copy the ``admin.pem`` to each workstation or replace the |chef server| 11 admin private key with the old private key. To do this, run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife download /users/admin.json
      $ grep public_key clients/admin.json

#. User-hashed passwords are not transferred to or from the |chef server| when using the ``knife download`` or ``knife upload`` subcommands. When using these commands to upgrade to a newer version of the |chef server osc| server, each user should run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      $ knife user edit user_name
   
   and then add the following to the |json| data:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      "password":"password_value"

#. |chef server| 11 prefers the ``syntax_check_cache_path`` setting for keeping track of cookbook files that have been syntax checked. Add the ``syntax_check_cache_path`` setting to the |knife rb| file if it is not already there. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      syntax_check_cache_path  '/home/<user>/.chef/syntax_check_cache'

#. Replace the public key in ``/users/admin.json`` with the results of the previous step:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife upload /users/admin.json
      $ cp <Chef 10 admin.pem> .chef/admin.pem

#. Remove the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rm /clients/admin.json

#. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife list /users

   to return a list of all users, including ``/users/admin.json``.


Upload Data
-----------------------------------------------------
To upload data to the |chef server| 11, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife upload /

This will transfer all of the data in the transfer directory to |chef server| 11.


Last Steps
-----------------------------------------------------
At this point, the |chef server| 11 should have all of the data that used to be on the |chef server| 10. Point the DNS or load balancer at the new |chef server|. The |chef client| should continue to run properly on all nodes and each workstation should be able to manage objects on the |chef server| using |knife|. If issues remain, try the IRC channel or email the chef@lists.chef.io discussion alias. If ``knife-essentials`` is the issue, file an issue in |github| or check the IRC channel.
