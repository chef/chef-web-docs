The |omnibus installer| is used to set up a |chef server| using a single command to install the server and all of its dependencies, including |erlang|, |ruby|, |rabbitmq|, |nginx|, and |postgresql|. The |omnibus installer| puts everything into a unique directory (``/etc/chef-server/``) so that the |chef server| will not interfere with other applications that may be running on the target server.
