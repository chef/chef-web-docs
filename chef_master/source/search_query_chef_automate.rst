.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

The dashboard in the **Nodes** tab exposes a search bar that allows you to search for nodes based off a
defined set of filters. You can search on the following terms:

  * Attribute
  * Cookbook
  * Environment
  * Node Name
  * Platform
  * Policy Group
  * Policy Name
  * Policy Revision
  * Recipe
  * Resource Name
  * Role

.. tag legacy_note

.. note:: The functionality described in this topic is for the search bar in Chef Automate 1.6.87 or later. If you need to continue using the previous search bar that was in earlier versions of Chef Automate, you can enable this view easily. We have included a new feature flag to activate the old search bar by typing ``legacy`` in the UI and toggling on this view in the menu. If you have trouble with the new search bar and find yourself continuing to use the legacy version, please `contact us <https://feedback.chef.io/>`_ with your feedback. Also, the legacy search bar will only be supported for 90 days.

Applying a filter
-----------------------------------------
To apply a filter, do the following:

#. Either begin typing one of the terms above to autocomplete the filter name or place your cursor in the search bar to bring up the filter list. 
#. Enter the value you wish to search on. Nesting in values should be denoted by dot(.)s. For an example, see the Attribute or Node Name examples below.
#. Click the blue arrow at the end of the search bar to apply the filter to your node data set. 

Applying multiple filters
-----------------------------------------

Multiple filters can be entered into the search bar to further focus search
results by entering the search filter and pressing ``Enter`` on your keyboard. The filter will then show up underneath the search bar. Additional filters can be applied, but note that these will be considered AND searches, which means the result list will be a union of both filtered results. Once you have created your combined filter, click the blue arrow at the end of the search bar. 

The following example shows how to search for nodes in a particular environment that are on the same platform.

Using wildcards
-----------------------------------------

In the screenshot above, one of the filters uses a wildcard(*) in the value. You can use wildcards either at the beginning, end, or on both beginning and end of a given value to provide further customization on how you filter your nodes. If you do not specify a wildcard, then only exact matches will be returned.

Examples
================================

**Attribute**

   All aws nodes with a public ip: ``Attribute: ec2.public_ipv4``

**Cookbook**

   All nodes running the 'postgres' cookbook: ``Cookbook: postgresql``

**Recipe**

   All nodes running a 'server' recipe: ``Recipe: server``

**Resource Name**

   All nodes that manage a resource named '/tmp': ``Resource Name: /tmp``

**Node Name**

   The node named 'node1.chef.io': ``Node Name: node1.chef.io``
