Firewalls and Ports
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/server_firewalls_and_ports.rst>`__

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_summary

All of the ports used by the Chef server are TCP ports. Refer to the operating system's manual or site systems administrators for instructions on how to enable changes to ports, if necessary.

.. end_tag

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_listening

All services must be listening on the appropriate ports. Most monitoring systems provide a means of testing whether a given port is accepting connections and service-specific tools may also be available. In addition, the generic system tool Telnet can also be used to initiate the connection:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ telnet HOST_NAME PORT

.. end_tag

.. note:: An "external" port is external from the perspective of a workstation (such as knife), a machine (the chef-client), or any other user that accesses the Chef server via the Chef server API.

Standalone
=====================================================
The following sections describe the ports that are required by the Chef server in a standalone configuration:

.. image:: ../../images/chef_server_ports_standalone.png

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_loopback

A single loopback interface should be configured using the ``127.0.0.1`` address. This ensures that all of the services are available to the Chef server, in the event that the Chef server attempts to contact itself from within a front or back end machine. All ports should be accessible through the loopback interface of their respective hosts.

.. end_tag

For a standalone installation, ensure that ports marked as external (marked as ``yes`` in the **External** column) are open and accessible via any firewalls that are in use:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Port
     - Service Name, Description
     - External
   * - 4321
     - **bookshelf**

       .. tag server_services_bookshelf

       The **bookshelf** service is an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)-compatible service that is used to store cookbooks, including all of the files---recipes, templates, and so on---that are associated with each cookbook.

       .. end_tag

     - no
   * - 80, 443, 9683
     - **nginx**

       .. tag server_services_nginx

       The **nginx** service is used to manage traffic to the Chef server, including virtual hosts for internal and external API request/response routing, external add-on request routing, and routing between front- and back-end components.

       .. end_tag

       .. note:: Port 9683 is used to internally load balance the **oc_bifrost** service.
     - yes
   * - 9463

     - **oc-id**

       .. tag server_services_oc_id

       The **oc-id** service enables OAuth 2.0 authentication to the Chef server by external applications, including Chef Supermarket.

Chef Push Jobs

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_push_jobs

TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10002. TCP/10000 is the default heartbeat port. TCP/10002 is the command port. It may be configured in the Chef push jobs configuration file . This port allows Chef push jobs clients to communicate with the Chef push jobs server. In a configuration with both front and back ends, this port only needs to be open on the back end servers. The Chef push jobs server waits for connections from the Chef push jobs client, and never initiates a connection to a Chef push jobs client.
