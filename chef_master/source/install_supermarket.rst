Install Private Supermarket
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/install_supermarket.rst>`__

.. tag supermarket_summary

Chef Supermarket is the site for community cookbooks. It provides an easily searchable cookbook repository and a friendly web UI. Cookbooks that are part of the Chef Supermarket are accessible by any Chef user.

There are two ways to use Chef Supermarket:

* The public Chef Supermarket is hosted by Chef and is located at |url supermarket|.
* A private Chef Supermarket may be installed on-premise behind the firewall on the internal network. Cookbook retrieval from a private Chef Supermarket is often faster than from the public Chef Supermarket because of closer proximity and fewer cookbooks to resolve. A private Chef Supermarket can also help formalize internal cookbook release management processes (e.g. "a cookbook is not released until it's published on the private Chef Supermarket").

.. end_tag

.. tag supermarket_private

The private Chef Supermarket is installed behind the firewall on the internal network. Outside of changing the location from which community cookbooks are maintained, it otherwise behaves the same as the public Chef Supermarket.

.. end_tag

.. note:: .. tag supermarket_private_source_code

          The source code for Chef Supermarket is located at the following URLs:

          * The application itself: https://github.com/chef/supermarket. Report issues to: https://github.com/chef/supermarket/issues.
          * The code that builds Chef Supermarket as an omnibus package: https://github.com/chef/omnibus-supermarket. Use a Kitchen-based environment to build your own omnibus packages.
          * The cookbook that is run by the ``supermarket-ctl reconfigure`` command: https://github.com/chef/omnibus-supermarket/tree/master/cookbooks/omnibus-supermarket

          .. end_tag

Requirements
=====================================================
A private Chef Supermarket has the following requirements:

* An operational Chef server (version 12.0 or higher) to act as the OAuth 2.0 provider
* A user account on the Chef server with ``admins`` priviliges
* A key for the user account on the Chef server
* An x86_64 compatible Linux host with at least 1 GB memory
* Sufficient disk space to meet project cookbook storage capacity or credentials to store cookbooks in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket

Chef Identify
=====================================================
Chef identify is an OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization service packaged with the Chef server. Chef Supermarket uses Chef identify must be configured to run with a private Chef Supermarket, after which users may use their same credentials to access the Chef Supermarket as they do to access the Chef server.

.. note:: The Chef Supermarket server must be able to reach (via HTTPS) the specified ``chef_server_url`` during OAuth 2.0 negotiation. This type of issue is typically with name resolution and firewall rules.

Configure
-----------------------------------------------------
To configure Chef Supermarket to use Chef identify, do the following:

#. Log on to the Chef server via SSH and elevate to an admin-level user. If running a multi-node Chef server cluster, log on to the node acting as the primary node in the cluster.
#. Update the ``/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb`` configuration file.

   .. tag config_ocid_application_hash_supermarket

   To define OAuth 2 information for Chef Supermarket, create a Hash similar to:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         oc_id['applications'] ||= {}
         oc_id['applications']['supermarket'] = {
           'redirect_uri' => 'https://supermarket.mycompany.com/auth/chef_oauth2/callback'
         }

   .. end_tag

#. Reconfigure the Chef server.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. OAuth 2.0 data is located in ``/etc/opscode/oc-id-applications/supermarket.json``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "name": "supermarket",
        "uid": "0bad0f2eb04e935718e081fb71asdfec3681c81acb9968a8e1e32451d08b",
        "secret": "17cf1141cc971a10ce307611beda7ffadstr4f1bc98d9f9ca76b9b127879",
        "redirect_uri": "https://supermarket.mycompany.com/auth/chef_oauth2/callback"
      }

   The ``uid`` and ``secret`` values will be needed later on during the setup process for Chef Supermarket.

.. note:: Add as many Chef identify applications to the chef-server.rb configuration file as necessary. A JSON file is generated for each application added, which contains the authentication tokens for that application. The secrets are added to the Chef identify database and are available to all nodes in the Chef server front end group. The generated JSON files do not need to be copied anywhere.

.. note:: The redirect URL specified for Chef identify **MUST** match the fqdn hostname of the Chef Supermarket server. The URI must also be correct: ``/auth/chef_oauth2/callback``. Otherwise, an error message similar to ``The redirect uri included is not valid.`` will be shown.

Install Supermarket
=====================================================
To install a private Chef Supermarket use the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook``. This cookbook is `available from the public <https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/supermarket-omnibus-cookbook>`__ Chef Supermarket.

* The ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` cookbook is attribute-driven; use a custom cookbook to specify your organization's unique ``node[supermarket_omnibus]`` attribute values.
* The custom cookbook is a wrapper around ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook``, which performs the actual installation of the Chef Supermarket packages, and then writes the custom ``node[supermarket_omnibus]`` values to ``/etc/supermarket/supermarket.json``.
* The Chef Supermarket package itself contains an internal cookbook which configures the already-installed package using the attributes defined in ``/etc/supermarket/supermarket.json``.

.. note:: In general, for production environments Chef recommends to start running Chef Supermarket with small virtual machines, and then increase the size of the virtual machine as necessary. Put the ``/var/opt/supermarket`` directory on a separate disk, and then use LVM so that may be expanded.

Create a Wrapper
-----------------------------------------------------
A wrapper cookbook is used to define project- and/or organization-specific requirements around a community cookbook.

.. image:: ../../images/supermarket_wrapper_cookbook.svg
   :width: 400px
   :align: left

In the case of installing a private Chef Supermarket, Chef recommends the use of a wrapper cookbook to specify certain attributes that are unique to your organization, while enabling the use of the generic installer cookbook which, in turn, installs the Chef Supermarket package behind your firewall.

All of the keys under ``node['supermarket_omnibus']`` are written out as ``/etc/supermarket/supermarket.json``. Add other keys as needed to override the default attributes specified in the Chef Supermarket `omnibus package <https://github.com/chef/omnibus-supermarket/blob/master/cookbooks/omnibus-supermarket/attributes/default.rb>`__. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_server_url'] = 'https://chefserver.mycompany.com'
   default['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_app_id'] = '14dfcf186221781cff51eedd5ac1616'
   default['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_secret'] = 'a49402219627cfa6318d58b13e90aca'
   default['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_verify_ssl'] = false

On your workstation, generate a new cookbook using the ``chef`` command line interface:

#. Generate the cookbook:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef generate cookbook my_supermarket_wrapper

#. Change directories into that cookbook:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd my_supermarket_wrapper

#. Defines the wrapper cookbookâ€™s dependency on the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` cookbook. Open the metadata.rb file of the newly-created cookbook, and then add the following line:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      depends 'supermarket-omnibus-cookbook'

#. Save and close the metadata.rb file.

#. Open the ``/recipes/default.rb`` recipe located within the newly-generated cookbook and add the following content:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      include_recipe 'supermarket-omnibus-cookbook'

   This ensures that the ``default.rb`` file in the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` is run.

Define Attributes
-----------------------------------------------------
Define the attributes for the Chef Supermarket installation and how it connects to the Chef server. One approach would be to hard-code attributes in the wrapper cookbook's ``default.rb`` recipe. A better approach is to place these attributes in a data bag, and then reference them from the recipe. For example, the data bag could be named ``apps`` and then a data bag item within the data bag could be named ``supermarket``.

The following attribute values must be defined:

* ``chef_server_url``
* ``chef_oauth2_app_id``
* ``chef_oauth2_secret``

You can get the chef_oauth2_app_id and chef_oauth2_secret values from your Chef server (which you configured earlier in this process) in ``/etc/opscode/oc-id-applications/supermarket.json``:

For ``chef_server_url``, enter in the url for your chef server.
For ``chef_oauth2_app_id``, enter in the uid from ``/etc/opscode/oc-id-applications/supermarket.json``
For ``chef_oauth2_secret``, enter in the secret from ``/etc/opscode/oc-id-applications/supermarket.json``

To define these attributes, do the following:

#. Open the ``/recipes/default.rb`` file and add the following, BEFORE the `include_recipe` line that was added in the previous step, (assuming a data bag named ``apps`` and a data bag item named ``supermarket``):

   .. code-block:: ruby

      app = data_bag_item('apps', 'supermarket')

#. Set the attributes from the data bag:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_server_url'] = app['chef_server_url']
      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_app_id'] = app['chef_oauth2_app_id']
      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_secret'] = app['chef_oauth2_secret']

   When finished, the ``/recipes/default.rb`` file should have code similar to:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      app = data_bag_item('apps', 'supermarket')

      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_server_url'] = app['chef_server_url']
      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_app_id'] = app['chef_oauth2_app_id']
      node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['chef_oauth2_secret'] = app['chef_oauth2_secret']

      include_recipe 'supermarket-omnibus-cookbook'

#. Save and close the ``/recipes/default.rb`` file.

.. note:: If you are running your private Supermarket in AWS, you may need to set an additional attribute for the node's public ip.  i.e. node node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['fqdn'] = your_node_public_ip

Upload the Wrapper
-----------------------------------------------------
The wrapper cookbook around the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` cookbook must be uploaded to the Chef server, along with any cookbooks against which the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` cookbook has dependencies.

To upload the cookbooks necessary to install Chef Supermarket, do the following:

#. Install Berkshelf:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ berks install

#. Change directories into ``~/.berkshelf/cookbooks``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks

#. Upload all cookbooks to the Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife cookbook upload -a

#. Change directories into the location in which the wrapper cookbook was created:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd path/to/wrapper/cookbook/

#. Upload the wrapper cookbook to the Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife cookbook upload -a

Bootstrap Supermarket
-----------------------------------------------------
Bootstrap the node on which Chef Supermarket is to be installed. For example, to bootstrap a node runnnig Ubuntu on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the command is similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap ip_address -N supermarket-node -x ubuntu --sudo

where

* ``-N`` defines the name of the Chef Supermarket node: ``supermarket-node``
* ``-x`` defines the (ssh) user name: ``ubuntu``
* ``--sudo`` ensures that sudo is used while running commands on the node during the bootstrap operation

When the bootstrap operation is finished, do the following:

#. Edit the node to add the wrapper cookbook's ``/recipes/default.rb`` recipe to the run-list:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife node edit supermarket-node

   where ``supermarket-node`` is the name of the node that was just bootstrapped.

#. Add the recipe to the run-list:

   .. code-block:: ruby

	  "run_list": [
	    "recipe[my_supermarket_wrapper::default]"
	  ]

#. Start the chef-client on the newly-bootstrapped Chef Supermarket node. For example, using SSH:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ssh ubuntu@your-supermarket-node-public-dns

#. After accessing the Chef Supermarket node, run the chef-client:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-client

Connect to Supermarket
=====================================================
To reach the newly spun up private Chef Supermarket, the hostname must be resolvable from a workstation. For production use, the hostname should have a DNS entry in an appropriate domain that is trusted by each user's workstation.

#. Visit the Chef Supermarket hostname in the browser. A private Chef Supermarket will generate and use a self-signed certificate, if a certificate is not supplied as part of the installation process (via the wrapper cookbook).
#. If an SSL notice is shown while connecting to Chef Supermarket via a web browser, accept the SSL certificate. A trusted SSL certificate should be used for  private Chef Supermarket that is used in production.
#. After opening Chef Supermarket in a web browser, click the **Create Account** link. A prompt to log in to the Chef server is shown, but only if the user is not already logged in. Authorize the Chef Supermarket to use the Chef server account for authentication.

.. note:: The redirect URL specified for Chef identify **MUST** match the fqdn hostname of the Chef Supermarket server. The URI must also be correct: ``/auth/chef_oauth2/callback``. Otherwise, an error message similar to ``The redirect uri included is not valid.`` will be shown.

Customize Supermarket
=====================================================
Chef Supermarket is a Ruby on Rails application with a PostgreSQL backend. The private Chef Supermarket configuration may be scaled-out, such as using an external database, using an external cache, and using an external cookbook storage location.

External Database
-----------------------------------------------------
A Chef Supermarket installation can use an external database running PostgreSQL (9.3 or higher) and with the ``pgpsql`` and ``pg_trgm`` installed and loaded. The public Chef Supermarket uses Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). To use an external database, configure the following attributes in the ``/recipes/default.rb`` recipe of the wrapper cookbook:

.. code-block:: ruby

   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['postgresql']['enable'] = false
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['user'] = 'supermarket'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['name'] = 'supermarket'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['host'] = 'yourcompany...rds.amazon.com'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['port'] = '5432'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['pool'] = '25'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['database']['password'] = 'topsecretneverguessit'

External Cache
-----------------------------------------------------
Chef Supermarket installations can also use an external cache store. The public Chef Supermarket uses Redis on Amazon ElastiCache. One Redis instance per private Chef Supermarket application server may be run safely. Use Redis 2.8 (or higher) for a high availability pair. To use an external cache, configure the following attributes in the ``/recipes/default.rb`` recipe of the wrapper cookbook:

.. code-block:: ruby

   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['redis']['enable'] = false
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['redis_url'] = 'redis://your-redis-instance:6379'

External Cookbook Storage
-----------------------------------------------------
Cookbook artifacts---tar.gz artifacts that are uploaded to Chef Supermarket when sharing a cookbook---can be stored either on the local filesystem of the Chef Supermarket node (``/var/opt/supermarket/data`` by default) or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. To use an S3 bucket, configure the following attributes in the ``/recipes/default.rb`` recipe of the wrapper cookbook:

.. code-block:: ruby

   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['s3_access_key_id'] = false
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['s3_bucket'] = 'supermarket'
   node.set['supermarket_omnibus']['config']['s3_access_key_id'] = 'yoursecretaccesskey'

Run Supermarket in Kitchen
=====================================================
To run Chef Supermarket in Kitchen, do the following:

#. Download the ``supermarket-omnibus-cookbook`` cookbook from:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/irvingpop/supermarket-omnibus-cookbook.git supermarket-omnibus-cookbook

      and then:

      $ cd supermarket-omnibus-cookbook

#. Create a .kitchen.yml file that is local to the repo: ``.kitchen.local.yml`` and then add the following:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      suites:
        - name: default
          run_list:
          - recipe[supermarket-omnibus-cookbook::default]
          attributes:
            supermarket_omnibus:
              chef_server_url: https://chefserver.mycompany.com
              chef_oauth2_app_id: 0bad0f2eb04e935718e081fb71e3b7bb47dc3681c81acb9968a8e1e32451d08b
              chef_oauth2_secret: 17cf1141cc971a10ce307611beda7f4dc6633bb54f1bc98d9f9ca76b9b127879
              chef_oauth2_verify_ssl: false

#. Install the ``vagrant-hostupdater`` plugin. This plugin enables automatically adding the names of machines to the ``/etc/hosts`` file. This is important when using OAuth 2.0, which cares about host names. The ``redirect_uri`` value in the Chef identify configuration reflects this name.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

#. Start the Chef Supermarket, and then test it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ kitchen converge default-centos-66 && kitchen verify default-centos-66

#. Go to Chef Supermarket, and then log on as a Chef user:

   .. code-block:: html

      https://default-centos-66

#. After logon, the following should be shown:

   .. image:: ../../images/supermarket_onpremises.png

Proxies
-----------------------------------------------------
If Kitchen fails due to being behind a proxy, update the .kitchen.yml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero
     solo_rb:
       http_proxy: http://192.168.1.1
       https_proxy: http://192.168.2.2

Kitchen Runs Slowly
-----------------------------------------------------
If Kitchen has to download and install the chef-client omnibus package every time, do the following to speed that process up:

#. Update the .kitchen.yml file so that Kitchen can cache the omnibus installer:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      provisioner:
        name: chef_zero
        chef_omnibus_install_options: -d /tmp/vagrant-cache/vagrant_omnibus

#. Cache the Yum repos using the ``vagrant-cachier`` plugin:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

   and then create a ``$VAGRANT_HOME/Vagrantfile``:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      Vagrant.configure("2") do The configuration file to use.
        config.vm.box = 'some-box'
        if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-cachier")
          config.cache.scope = :box
          config.cache.enable :chef
          config.cache.enable :apt
          config.cache.enable :yum
          config.cache.enable :gem
        end
      end

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd supermarket-omnibus-cookbook

#. Create a .kitchen.yml file that is local to the repo: ``.kitchen.local.yml`` and then add the following:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      suites:
        - name: default
          run_list:
          - recipe[supermarket-omnibus-cookbook::default]
          attributes:
            supermarket_omnibus:
              chef_server_url: https://chefserver.mycompany.com
              chef_oauth2_app_id: 0bad0f2eb04e935718e081fb71e3b7bb47dc3681c81acb9968a8e1e32451d08b
              chef_oauth2_secret: 17cf1141cc971a10ce307611beda7f4dc6633bb54f1bc98d9f9ca76b9b127879
              chef_oauth2_verify_ssl: false

#. Install the ``vagrant-hostupdater`` plugin. This plugin enables automatically adding the names of machines to the ``/etc/hosts`` file. This is important when using OAuth 2.0, which cares about host names. The ``redirect_uri`` value in the Chef identify configuration reflects this name.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

#. Start the Chef Supermarket, and then test it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ kitchen converge default-centos-66 && kitchen verify default-centos-66

#. Go to Chef Supermarket, and then log on as a Chef user:

   .. code-block:: html

      https://default-centos-66

#. After logon, the following should be shown:

   .. image:: ../../images/supermarket_onpremises.png
