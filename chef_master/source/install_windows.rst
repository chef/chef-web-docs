=====================================================
Install the chef-client on Windows Nodes
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/install_windows.rst>`__


Nodes
=====================================================
.. tag node

A node is any machine---physical, virtual, cloud, network device, etc.---that is under management by Chef.

.. end_tag

.. tag windows_install_overview

The chef-client can be installed on machines running Microsoft Windows in the following ways:

* By using `knife windows </knife_windows.html>`__ to bootstrap the chef-client; this process requires the target node be available via the WinRM port (typically port 5985)
* By downloading the chef-client to the target node, and then running the Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) locally
* By using an existing process already in place for managing Microsoft Windows machines, such as System Center

To run the chef-client at periodic intervals (so that it can check in with the Chef server automatically), configure the chef-client to run as a service or as a scheduled task. (The chef-client can be configured to run as a service during the setup process.)

.. end_tag

Use knife windows
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag knife_windows_summary

The ``knife windows`` subcommand is used to configure and interact with nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running Microsoft Windows. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows native objects---batch scripts, Windows PowerShell scripts, or scripting library variables---to be called by external applications. The ``knife windows`` subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of authentication.

.. end_tag

Ports
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag knife_windows_winrm_ports

WinRM requires that a target node be accessible via the ports configured to support access via HTTP or HTTPS.

.. end_tag

Msiexec.exe
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_msiexec

Msiexec.exe is used to install the chef-client on a node as part of a bootstrap operation. The actual command that is run by the default bootstrap script is:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ msiexec /qn /i "%LOCAL_DESTINATION_MSI_PATH%"

where ``/qn`` is used to set the user interface level to "No UI", ``/i`` is used to define the location in which the chef-client is installed, and ``"%LOCAL_DESTINATION_MSI_PATH%"`` is a variable defined in the default `windows-chef-client-msi.erb <https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/windows-chef-client-msi.erb>`_ bootstrap template. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367988%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for more information about the options available to Msiexec.exe.

.. end_tag

ADDLOCAL Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag windows_msiexec_addlocal

The ``ADDLOCAL`` parameter adds two setup options that are specific to the chef-client. These options can be passed along with an Msiexec.exe command:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``ChefClientFeature``
     - Use to install the chef-client.
   * - ``ChefSchTaskFeature``
     - Use to configure the chef-client as a scheduled task in Microsoft Windows.
   * - ``ChefPSModuleFeature``
     - Used to install the chef PowerShell module. This will enable chef command line utilities within PowerShell.

First install the chef-client, and then enable it to run as a scheduled task. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ msiexec /qn /i C:\inst\chef-client-14.5.27-1-x64.msi ADDLOCAL="ChefClientFeature,ChefSchTaskFeature,ChefPSModuleFeature"

.. end_tag

Use MSI Installer
-----------------------------------------------------
A Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) is available for installing the chef-client on a Microsoft Windows machine at `Chef Downloads <https://downloads.chef.io/>`__

Run as a Scheduled Task
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The chef-client can be run as a scheduled task. On the Microsoft Windows platform, a scheduled task provides more visibility, configurability, and reliability around log rotation and permissions, as compared to running the chef-client as a service. A scheduled task:

* Prevents log rotation issues, such as filling a disk partition
* Does not have an indeterminate status, such as a service for which only the watcher is "running"
* Prevents insufficient permissions related to service context
* Prevents issues related to a system reboot

Scheduled Task Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag install_chef_client_windows_as_scheduled_task

To run the chef-client at periodic intervals (so that it can check in with the Chef server automatically), configure the chef-client to run as a scheduled task. This can be done via the MSI, by selecting the **Chef Unattended Execution Options** --> **Chef Client Scheduled Task** option on the **Custom Setup** page or by running the following command after the chef-client is installed:

For example:

.. code-block:: none

   $ SCHTASKS.EXE /CREATE /TN ChefClientSchTask /SC MINUTE /MO 30 /F /RU "System" /RP /RL HIGHEST /TR "cmd /c \"C:\opscode\chef\embedded\bin\ruby.exe C:\opscode\chef\bin\chef-client -L C:\chef\chef-client.log -c C:\chef\client.rb\""

Refer `Schedule a Task <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc748993(v=ws.11)>`_ for more details.

After the chef-client is configured to run as a scheduled task, the default file path is: ``c:\chef\chef-client.log``.

.. end_tag

Use an Existing Process
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_install_system_center

Many organizations already have processes in place for managing the applications and settings on various Microsoft Windows machines. For example, System Center. The chef-client can be installed using this method.

.. end_tag

PATH System Variable
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_environment_variable_path

On Microsoft Windows, the chef-client must have two entries added to the ``PATH`` environment variable:

* ``C:\opscode\chef\bin``
* ``C:\opscode\chef\embedded\bin``

This is typically done during the installation of the chef-client automatically. If these values (for any reason) are not in the ``PATH`` environment variable, the chef-client will not run properly.

.. image:: ../../images/includes_windows_environment_variable_path.png

This value can be set from a recipe. For example, from the ``php`` cookbook:

.. code-block:: ruby

   #  the following code sample comes from the ``package`` recipe in the ``php`` cookbook: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/php

   if platform?('windows')

     include_recipe 'iis::mod_cgi'

     install_dir = File.expand_path(node['php']['conf_dir']).gsub('/', '\\')
     windows_package node['php']['windows']['msi_name'] do
       source node['php']['windows']['msi_source']
       installer_type :msi

       options %W[
         /quiet
         INSTALLDIR="#{install_dir}"
         ADDLOCAL=#{node['php']['packages'].join(',')}
       ].join(' ')
   end

   ...

   ENV['PATH'] += ";#{install_dir}"
   windows_path install_dir

   ...

.. end_tag
