osx_profile resource
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_osx_profile.rst>`__

.. tag resource_osx_profile_summary

Use the **osx_profile** resource to manage configuration profiles (``.mobileconfig`` files) on the macOS platform. The **osx_profile** resource installs profiles by using the ``uuidgen`` library to generate a unique ``ProfileUUID``, and then using the ``profiles`` command to install the profile on the system.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
The osx_profile resource has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

  osx_profile 'name' do
    identifier        String
    path              String
    profile           String, Hash
    profile_name      String # default value: 'name' unless specified
    action            Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
  end

where:

* ``osx_profile`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``identifier``, ``path``, ``profile``, and ``profile_name`` are the properties available to this resource.

Actions
=====================================================
The osx_profile resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install the specified configuration profile.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   This resource block does not act unless notified by another resource to take action. Once notified, this resource block either runs immediately or is queued up to run at the end of the Chef Infra Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:remove``
   Remove the specified configuration profile.



Properties
=====================================================
The osx_profile resource has the following properties:

``identifier``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Use to specify the identifier for the profile, such as ``com.company.screensaver``.


``path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to write the profile to disk before loading it.

``profile``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Hash

   Use to specify a profile. This may be the name of a profile contained in a cookbook or a Hash that contains the contents of the profile.

``profile_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``The resource block's name``

   Use to specify the name of the profile, if different from the name of the resource block.



Common Resource Functionality
=====================================================

Chef resources include common properties, notifications, and resource guards.

Common Properties
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_properties

The following properties are common to every resource:

``ignore_failure``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``retries``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

  The number of attempts to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

  The retry delay (in seconds).

``sensitive``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Ensure that sensitive resource data is not logged by the chef-client.

.. end_tag

Notifications
-----------------------------------------------------

``notifies``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

  .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

  A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

  .. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

``subscribes``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

.. code-block:: ruby

 file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
   mode '0600'
   owner 'root'
 end

 service 'nginx' do
   subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
 end

In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of the chef-client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell the chef-client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for the chef-client to do nothing.

.. end_tag
.. tag resources_common_guards_properties

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of the chef-client run:

``not_if``
  Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
  Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag


Examples
=====================================================

The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes:

**One liner to install profile from cookbook file**

.. tag resource_osx_profile_install_file_oneline

The ``profiles`` command will be used to install the specified configuration profile.

.. code-block:: ruby

   osx_profile 'com.company.screensaver.mobileconfig'

.. end_tag

**Install profile from cookbook file**

.. tag resource_osx_profile_install_file

The ``profiles`` command will be used to install the specified configuration profile. It can be in sub-directory within a cookbook.

.. code-block:: ruby

   osx_profile 'Install screensaver profile' do
     profile 'screensaver/com.company.screensaver.mobileconfig'
   end

.. end_tag

**Install profile from a hash**

.. tag resource_osx_profile_install_hash

The ``profiles`` command will be used to install the configuration profile, which is provided as a hash.

.. code-block:: ruby

   profile_hash = {
     'PayloadIdentifier' => 'com.company.screensaver',
     'PayloadRemovalDisallowed' => false,
     'PayloadScope' => 'System',
     'PayloadType' => 'Configuration',
     'PayloadUUID' => '1781fbec-3325-565f-9022-8aa28135c3cc',
     'PayloadOrganization' => 'Chef',
     'PayloadVersion' => 1,
     'PayloadDisplayName' => 'Screensaver Settings',
     'PayloadContent'=> [
       {
         'PayloadType' => 'com.apple.ManagedClient.preferences',
         'PayloadVersion' => 1,
         'PayloadIdentifier' => 'com.company.screensaver',
         'PayloadUUID' => '73fc30e0-1e57-0131-c32d-000c2944c108',
         'PayloadEnabled' => true,
         'PayloadDisplayName' => 'com.apple.screensaver',
         'PayloadContent' => {
           'com.apple.screensaver' => {
             'Forced' => [
               {
                 'mcx_preference_settings' => {
                   'idleTime' => 0,
                 }
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }

   osx_profile 'Install screensaver profile' do
     profile profile_hash
   end

.. end_tag

**Remove profile using identifier in resource name**

.. tag resource_osx_profile_remove_by_name

The ``profiles`` command will be used to remove the configuration profile specified by the provided ``identifier`` property.

.. code-block:: ruby

   osx_profile 'com.company.screensaver' do
     action :remove
   end

.. end_tag

**Remove profile by identifier and user friendly resource name**

.. tag resource_osx_profile_remove_by_identifier

The ``profiles`` command will be used to remove the configuration profile specified by the provided ``identifier`` property.

.. code-block:: ruby

   osx_profile 'Remove screensaver profile' do
     identifier 'com.company.screensaver'
     action :remove
   end

.. end_tag
