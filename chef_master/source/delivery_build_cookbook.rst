About the build-cookbook
=======================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/delivery_build_cookbook.rst>`__

Chef Automate uses the chef-client to run recipes for each phase in a build pipeline. The phases are grouped into different stages.

The following illustration shows the phases of each pipeline stage.

The recipes for these phases are run from the ``build-cookbook``. A ``build-cookbook`` varies by project type, because projects may use different tools for running unit tests, syntax checks, or lint analysis.

Build Cookbook Structure
=======================================================
A ``build-cookbook`` is located in the ``.delivery`` directory in a project and defines how the Chef Automate pipeline will build, test, and deploy a project. A ``build-cookbook`` should be initially configured to use the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook as a dependency in all recipes, after which it may be modified as necessary. The ``build-cookbook`` is effectively a wrapper cookbook for the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook.

A build node is configured via two isolated chef-client runs: First, the ``default.rb`` recipe is run by the chef-client as the root user, after which the phase-specific recipe is run by the chef-client as the build user (``dbuild``). For example, during the unit phase the first run is the ``default.rb`` file, and then the second is the ``unit.rb`` file.

The following recipes should be configured to include the corresponding ``delivery-truck`` recipe as a dependency:

``default.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_default

   Use the ``default.rb`` recipe to configure a project on a build node. This recipe is run by the chef-client as the root user and is a standard default recipe, i.e. the chef-client may use this recipe to configure this project on any node, whether or not it's part of a Chef Automate pipeline.

   .. end_tag

``deploy.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_deploy

   Use the ``deploy.rb`` recipe to define how artifacts are published to one (or more) nodes after they are built successfully. The contents of this recipe are project-specific.

   .. end_tag

``functional.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_functional

   Use the ``functional.rb`` recipe to run a set functional tests that are specific to this project. The tests are run on a single build node and should target and/or trigger tests against the set of nodes that are updated when this artifact deploys.

   .. end_tag

``lint.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_lint

   Use the ``lint.rb`` recipe to run linting and other static analysis tools against a project's source code.

   .. end_tag

``provision.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_provision

   Use the ``provision.rb`` recipe to build any infrastructure that is necessary to run an application. This recipe will discover all ``metadata.rb`` and/or ``metadata.json`` files that are located in the project's root directory, plus any cookbook directories located under ``cookbooks/<project_cookbooks>``.

   .. end_tag

``publish.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_publish

   Use the ``publish.rb`` recipe to make any artifact generated by this project available to other phases in the Chef Automate pipeline.

   .. end_tag

``quality.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_quality

   Use the ``quality.rb`` recipe to run additional code quality and reporting tools.

   .. end_tag

``security.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_security

   Use the ``security.rb`` recipe to execute security tests against a project's source code.

   .. end_tag

``smoke.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_smoke

   Use the ``smoke.rb`` recipe to run smoke tests against deployed build artifacts to ensure they were deployed correctly and are minimally functional.

   .. end_tag

``syntax.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_syntax

   Use the ``syntax.rb`` recipe to verify that changes result in syntactically correct code. This process may involve compiling the code or running a validator for interpreted languages.

   .. end_tag

``unit.rb``
   .. tag delivery_cookbook_common_recipe_unit

   Use the ``unit.rb`` recipe to run unit tests for the project.

   .. end_tag

Create Build Cookbook
=======================================================
.. tag delivery_cookbook_setup

Pull the ``delivery-truck`` and ``delivery-sugar`` cookbooks into a ``build-cookbook``. This requires editing the Berksfile, and then updating the metadata.rb file.

.. end_tag

.. note:: This section assumes that Chef Automate is already configured, a project exists, a user may access that project and submit changes, and that all work is being done from that project's root directory.

Edit the Berksfile
-------------------------------------------------------
.. tag delivery_cookbook_setup_berksfile

The Berksfile for a ``build-cookbook`` is located at ``.delivery/build-cookbook/Berksfile``. Update it to include:

.. code-block:: ruby

   source "https://supermarket.chef.io"

   metadata

   cookbook 'delivery-truck', github: 'chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck'
   cookbook 'delivery-sugar', github: 'chef-cookbooks/delivery-sugar'

This will ensure that the latest versions of the ``delivery-truck`` and ``delivery-sugar`` cookbooks are pulled into the ``build-cookbook`` every time a change is sent to the Chef Automate project pipeline.

.. end_tag

Edit metadata.rb
-------------------------------------------------------
.. tag delivery_cookbook_setup_metadata

The metadata.rb for a ``build-cookbook`` is located at ``.delivery/build-cookbook/metadata.rb``. Update it to include:

.. code-block:: none

   depends 'delivery-truck'

This will ensure that the ``build-cookbook`` has a dependency on the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook.

.. end_tag

Add delivery-truck to Recipes
-------------------------------------------------------
.. tag delivery_cookbook_setup_recipes

A ``build-cookbook`` should define the same phases as the recipes included in the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook: ``default.rb``, ``deploy.rb``, ``functional.rb``, ``lint.rb``, ``provision.rb``, ``publish.rb``, ``quality.rb``, ``security.rb``, ``smoke.rb``, ``syntax.rb``, and ``unit.rb``. For example, a build cookbook's recipe directory should contain an identical list of recipes. For example, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls .delivery/build-cookbook/recipes/

the list of recipes should be:

.. code-block:: bash

   default.rb
   deploy.rb
   functional.rb
   lint.rb
   provision.rb
   publish.rb
   quality.rb
   security.rb
   smoke.rb
   syntax.rb
   unit.rb

Each recipe corresponds to a specific phase in the Chef Automate pipeline. The recipes in the ``build-cookbook`` should include the same-named recipe in the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook. For example, to include the ``lint.rb`` recipe from the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook, update the ``lint.rb`` recipe in the ``build-cookbook`` to add the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   include_recipe 'delivery-truck::lint'

and then add to the ``unit.rb`` recipe:

.. code-block:: none

   include_recipe 'delivery-truck::unit'

and so on for all of the recipes. This ensures that all of the default behavior for all of the phases for the entire pipeline is available to this ``build-cookbook``.

.. end_tag

Set Up Projects
=======================================================
Chef Automate uses projects to organize work across multiple teams. You can create as many projects as you need. A common approach is to have one project for each major component of the system. Each project has its own git repository.

Each project has one (or more) pipelines. Each pipeline has a designated target branch into which it will merge approved changes. Chef Automate uses a "gated master" model that manages merges to the target branch. The typical setup is for each project to have a single pipeline that targets the master branch.

Use the Delivery CLI
-------------------------------------------------------
.. tag delivery_projects_add_with_delivery_truck

.. note:: These instructions assume that you will use Chef Automate as your source code source of truth and that Chef Automate is not integrated with GitHub Enterprise or GitHub.com.

This topic describes the recommended setup for a Chef cookbook project using Chef Automate.

The following example shows how to create a cookbook, with project and pipeline, configure it to be built with Chef Automate, and then imported it into Chef Automate itself. From your workstation as user with admin privileges on the Chef Automate server, do the following:

#. Make a working directory (``workspace`` in the example):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mkdir ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace

#. Setup the Delivery CLI to, by default, contact the Chef Automate server at SERVER, with a default ENTERPRISE and ORGANIZATION:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ delivery setup --server=SERVER --ent=ENTERPRISE --org=ORGANIZATION --user=USERNAME

   .. note:: The server, enterprise, organization, and user must already exist.

#. Create a cookbook:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef generate cookbook NEW-COOKBOOK-NAME

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd NEW-COOKBOOK-NAME

   This uses the Chef development kit to generate a new cookbook, including a default recipe and default ChefSpec tests.

#. Create an initial commit (use ``git status`` to verify the change) on the "master" branch:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git add .

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'

   Running ``chef generate`` initialized a git repository automatically for this cookbook. If you created the build cookbook manually, initialize the git repository with the ``git init`` command.

#. Initialize the cookbook for Chef Automate:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ delivery init

   This creates a new project in Chef Automate, pushes the master branch, creates a feature branch, generates a default Chef Automate project configuration file, pushes the first change for review, and then opens a browser window that shows the change.

#. Now that you have initialized your project, it is recommended that you integrate the delivery-truck cookbook with your project. Delivery Truck can ensure good build cookbook behavior as well as provide you with recipes already set up to test your project cookbooks and applications.

.. end_tag

Use the Web UI
-------------------------------------------------------
To add a project using the Chef Automate web UI:

#. Log into the Chef Automate web UI as user with **Admin** role.
#. Open the **Organizations** page and select your organization.
#. Click the plus sign (**+**) next to **Add a New Project**.

#. Enter a project name and select a **Source Code Provider**, either **Chef Delivery** (the default), **GitHub**, or **Bitbucket**.

#. If you choose **Chef Delivery**, simply click **Save and Close** to finish adding the project.

#. If you choose **GitHub**, a text area opens. Enter the following:

      **GitHub Organization Name**

      **GitHub Project Name**

      **Pipeline Branch** The name of the target branch that Chef Automate will manage (most projects will have master as the target branch). The target branch must exist in the repository.

      **Verify SSL**  When selected, have GitHub perform SSL certificate verification when it connects to Chef Automate to run its web hooks.

#. If you choose **Bitbucket**, you must follow the integration steps in :doc:`Integrate Delivery with Bitbucket </integrate_delivery_bitbucket>` before you can add a project. After you have done that you can add a new Chef Automate project through this web UI by entering the Bitbucket project key, repository, and target branch information.

#. Click **Save and Close**.

Custom build-cookbook
=======================================================
``chef generate`` can also create a custom build cookbook for use with Delivery:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef generate build-cookbook NAME [options]

The following options are available with ``chef generate build-cookbook``:

.. code-block:: none

     -C, --copyright COPYRIGHT        Name of the copyright holder - defaults to 'The Authors'
     -m, --email EMAIL                Email address of the author - defaults to 'you@example.com'
     -a, --generator-arg KEY=VALUE    Use to set arbitrary attribute KEY to VALUE in the code_generator cookbook
     -h, --help                       Show this message
     -I, --license LICENSE            all_rights, apachev2, mit, gplv2, gplv3 - defaults to all_rights
     -v, --version                    Show chef version
     -g GENERATOR_COOKBOOK_PATH,      Use GENERATOR_COOKBOOK_PATH for the code_generator cookbook
            --generator-cookbook
