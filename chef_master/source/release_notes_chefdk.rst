Release Notes: Chef Development Kit 0.19 - 1.1
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/release_notes_chefdk.rst>`__

Chef Development Kit is released on a monthly schedule with new releases the third Monday of every month. Below are the major changes for each release. For a detailed list of changes see the `Chef CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/chef/chef-dk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__

What's New in 1.1
=====================================================

New InSpec Test Location
-----------------------------------------------------

To address bugs and confusion with the previous ``test/recipes`` location, all newly generated
cookbooks and recipes will place their InSpec tests in ``test/smoke/default``. This
placement creates the association of the `smoke` phase in Chef Automate and the `default` Test Kitchen suite
where the tests are run.

Default Docker image in kitchen-dokken is now official Chef image
------------------------------------------------------------------

`chef/chef <https://hub.docker.com/r/chef/chef>`_ is now the default Docker image used in `kitchen-dokken <https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken>`_.

New Test Kitchen driver caching mechanisms
-----------------------------------------------------

Test Kitchen will automatically cache downloaded chef-client packages for use between provisions.
For people who use the ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver to run Chef, it will automatically consume the
new caching mechanism to share the client packages to the guest VM, meaning that you no longer
have to wait for the client to download on every guest provision.

In addition, if the chef-client packages are already cached, then it is now possible to use
Test Kitchen completely off-line.

Cookstyle 1.1.0 with new code linting Cops
-----------------------------------------------------

Cookstyle has been updated from ``0.0.1`` to ``1.1.0``, which upgrades the RuboCop engine from ``0.39``
to ``0.46``, and enables several new cops. This will most likely result in Cookstyle warnings on
cookbooks that previously passed.

**Newly Disabled Cops:**

- Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity
- Style/NumericLiterals
- Style/RegexpLiteral in 'tests' directory
- Style/AsciiComments
- Style/TernaryParentheses
- Metrics/ClassLength
- All rails/* cops

**Newly Enabled Cops:**

- Bundler/DuplicatedGem
- Style/SpaceInsideArrayPercentLiteral
- Style/NumericPredicate
- Style/EmptyCaseCondition
- Style/EachForSimpleLoop
- Style/PreferredHashMethods
- Lint/UnifiedInteger
- Lint/PercentSymbolArray
- Lint/PercentStringArray
- Lint/EmptyWhen
- Lint/EmptyExpression
- Lint/DuplicateCaseCondition
- Style/TrailingCommaInLiteral
- Lint/ShadowedException

New DCO tool included
-----------------------------------------------------

We have included a new DCO command-line tool that makes it easier to contribute to projects like
Chef that use the Developer Certificate of Origin. The tool allows you to enable/disable DCO
sign-offs on a per repository basis and also allows you to retroactively sign off all commits on
a branch. See https://github.com/coderanger/dco for details.
