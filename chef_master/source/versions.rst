Lifecycle Definitions

**Deprecated**

This stage indicates that an application or version is no longer in active development and will eventually move to end of life status.  Chef continues to provide support `according to our SLAs <https://www.chef.io/service-level-agreement/>`_.

**End of Life (EOL)**
