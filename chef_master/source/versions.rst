Supported Versions
==============================================

This section lists the versions of the OSS and commercial Chef products we currently support as well as the support level (expressed as a lifecycle status) for each product. The lifecycle status defines the involvement by Chef Software in updating and maintaining each product in the list below.

Lifecycle Definitions
----------------------------------------------

**Generally Available (GA)**

This stage indicates that an application or version is in active development or is considered feature complete.

* Chef continues to provide releases to the application or version in response to customer needs and security vulnerabilities
* Chef welcomes customer feature requests for the product roadmap for the application

**Deprecated**

This stage indicates that an application or version is no longer in active development and will eventually move to end of life status.  Chef continues to provide support `according to our SLAs <https://www.chef.io/service-level-agreement/>`_.

* Chef no longer provides scheduled releases
* Customers should use the GA alternative to these products; contact us for help with product selection and deployment
* Chef may provide a release for a critical defect or security vulnerability

**End of Life (EOL)**

This stage indicates that Chef has set a date after which the application or version will no longer be supported or recommended for use by customers.
