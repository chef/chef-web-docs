.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

Adding SSH, WinRM, and Sudo credentials is the essential first step for using the Chef Automate Compliance Scanner. After adding credentials, you’ll be able to add nodes and create ad-hoc scan jobs.

Depending on how you’ve set up your nodes, you may need to set up more than one key that uses the same SSH Private Key with different usernames. For example, AWS EC2 Amazon Linux nodes require the username ``ec2-user``, while AWS EC2 Ubuntu nodes require the username ``ubuntu`` or ``root``. The **Credentials** tab enable saving two different sets of credentials, both using the same SSH Private Key and different user names.  However, credentials with different content may also reuse identical key names; it may be advisable to reduce confusion by follow a naming pattern specifying the key name and platform to distinguish between similar credentials.

.. Warning:: A credential name may be reused, even when it contains different usernames or keys.
