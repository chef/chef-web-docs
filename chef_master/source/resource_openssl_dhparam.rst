openssl_dhparam resource
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_openssl_dhparam.rst>`__

Use the **openssl_dhparam** resource to generate ``dhparam.pem`` files. If a valid ``dhparam.pem`` file is found at the specified location, no new file will be created. If a file is found at the specified location, but it is not a valid dhparam file, it will be overwritten.

**New in Chef Client 14.0.**

Syntax
=====================================================
The openssl_dhparam resource has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

  openssl_dhparam 'name' do
    generator       Integer # default value: 2
    group           String
    key_length      Integer # default value: 2048
    mode            Integer, String # default value: 0640
    owner           String
    path            String # default value: 'name' unless specified
    action          Symbol # defaults to :create if not specified
  end

where:

* ``openssl_dhparam`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``generator``, ``group``, ``key_length``, ``mode``, ``owner``, and ``path`` are the properties available to this resource.

Actions
=====================================================

The openssl_dhparam resource has the following actions:

``:create``
   Default. Create the ``dhparam.pem`` file.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
``generator``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The desired Diffie-Hellmann generator; available options are ``2`` and ``5``.

``group``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The group ownership applied to all files created by the resource.

``key_length``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2048``

   The desired bit length of the generated key; available options are ``1024``, ``2048``, ``4096``, and ``8192``.

``mode``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, String | **Default Value:** ``0640``

   The permission mode applied to all files created by the resource.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``owner``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The owner applied to all files created by the resource.

``path``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to write the file to, if it differs from the resource name.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
**Create a dhparam file**

.. code-block:: ruby

   openssl_dhparam '/etc/httpd/ssl/dhparam.pem'

**Create a dhparam file with a specific key length**

.. code-block:: ruby

   openssl_dhparam '/etc/httpd/ssl/dhparam.pem' do
     key_length 4096
   end

**Create a dhparam file with specific user/group ownership**

.. code-block:: ruby

   openssl_dhparam '/etc/httpd/ssl/dhparam.pem' do
     owner 'www-data'
     group 'www-data'
   end

**Manually specify the dhparam file path**

.. code-block:: ruby

   openssl_dhparam 'httpd_dhparam' do
     path '/etc/httpd/ssl/dhparam.pem'
   end
