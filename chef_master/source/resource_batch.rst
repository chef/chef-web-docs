.. tag resource_batch_summary

Use the **batch** resource to execute a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter. The **batch** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. This resource inherits actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``) and properties (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) from the **execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag resource_batch_syntax

A **batch** resource block executes a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code <<-EOH
       echo %TEMP%
       echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%
       echo %PATH%
       echo %WINDIR%
       EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **batch** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array
     creates                    String
     cwd                        String
     flags                      String
     group                      String, Integer
     guard_interpreter          Symbol
     interpreter                String
     notifies                   # see description
     provider                   Chef::Provider::Batch
     returns                    Integer, Array
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    Integer, Float
     user                       String, Integer
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :run if not specified
   end

where

* ``batch`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``command`` is the command to be run and ``cwd`` is the location from which the command is run
* ``:action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``code``, ``command``, ``creates``, ``cwd``, ``flags``, ``group``, ``guard_interpreter``, ``interpreter``, ``provider``, ``returns``, ``timeout``, and ``user`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
=====================================================
.. tag resource_batch_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the chef-client run.

   .. end_tag

``:run``
   Run a batch file.

.. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
.. tag resource_batch_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If a value is not provided, the chef-client defaults to the correct value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is raised when anything other than ``:i386`` is specified for a 32-bit process. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for 32-bit processes) and ``:x86_64`` (for 64-bit processes).

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

``command``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The name of the command to be executed.

``creates``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.

``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The current working directory from which a command is run.

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One or more command line flags that are passed to the interpreter when a command is invoked.

``group``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a command.

``guard_interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   Default value: ``:batch``. When this property is set to ``:batch``, the 64-bit version of the cmd.exe shell will be used to evaluate strings values for the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` properties. Set this value to ``:default`` to use the 32-bit version of the cmd.exe shell.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the default value of this property is not supported.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``returns``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, Array

   The return value for a command. This may be an array of accepted values. An exception is raised when the return value(s) do not match. Default value: ``0``.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Types:** Integer, Float

   The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing out. Default value: ``3600``.

``user``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   A user name or identifier that must be changed before running a command.

.. note:: See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490880.aspx for more information about the cmd.exe interpreter.

.. end_tag

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of the chef-client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell the chef-client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for the chef-client to do nothing.

.. end_tag

**Attributes**

.. tag resources_common_guards_attributes

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of the chef-client run:

``not_if``
   Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
   Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag

**Arguments**

.. tag resources_common_guards_arguments

The following arguments can be used with the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` guard properties:

``:user``
   Specify the user that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :user => 'adam'

``:group``
   Specify the group that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :group => 'adam'

``:environment``
   Specify a Hash of environment variables to be set. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :environment => {
        'HOME' => '/home/adam'
      }

``:cwd``
   Set the current working directory before running a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam passwd', :cwd => '/etc'

``:timeout``
   Set a timeout for a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'sleep 10000', :timeout => 10

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Unzip a file, and then move it**

.. tag resource_batch_unzip_file_and_move

To run a batch file that unzips and then moves Ruby, do something like:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'unzip_and_move_ruby' do
     code <<-EOH
       7z.exe x #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32.7z
         -oC:\\source -r -y
       xcopy C:\\source\\ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32 C:\\ruby /e /y
       EOH
   end

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code <<-EOH
       echo %TEMP%
       echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%
       echo %PATH%
       echo %WINDIR%
       EOH
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'unzip_and_move_ruby' do
     code <<-EOH
       7z.exe x #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32.7z
         -oC:\\source -r -y
       xcopy C:\\source\\ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32 C:\\ruby /e /y
       EOH
   end

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code 'echo %TEMP%\\necho %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\necho %PATH%\\necho %WINDIR%'
   end

.. end_tag
