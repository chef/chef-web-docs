.. note:: This documentation is meant to support existing Chef customers using Reporting.

          Are you a new Chef customer, or looking to gain better insight into your fleet? Take advantage of :doc:`Chef Automate </chef_automate>`. You'll get a graphical interface and query language that gives you insight into operational, compliance, and workflow events. You can `download Chef Automate here <https://downloads.chef.io/automate/>`__.

.. end_tag

.. tag api_reporting_summary

The Reporting API is a REST API that provides access to Reporting data that is collected during a chef-client run. Reporting data is collected only for nodes that have permission to publish Reporting data to the Chef server and only for organizations that have Reporting enabled.

          This feature is included as part of the Chef Automate license agreement and is `available via subscription <https://www.chef.io/pricing/>`_.

          .. end_tag

Requirements
=====================================================
.. tag api_chef_server_requirements

The Chef server API has the following requirements:

* Access to a Chef server running version 0.10.x or above.
* The ``Accept`` header must be set to ``application/json``.
* For ``PUT`` and ``POST`` requests, the ``Content-Type`` header must be set to ``application/json``.
* The ``X-Chef-Version`` header must be set to the version of the Chef server API that is being used.
* A request must be signed using ``Mixlib::Authentication``.
* A request must be well-formatted. The easiest way to ensure a well-formatted request is to use the ``Chef::REST`` library.

Changed in Chef Client 12.7, now code that uses ``Chef::Rest`` must use ``require ``chef\rest``

.. end_tag

Authentication Headers
=====================================================
.. tag api_chef_server_headers

Authentication to the Chef server occurs when a specific set of HTTP headers are signed using a private key that is associated with the machine from which the request is made. The request is authorized if the Chef server can verify the signature using the public key. Only authorized actions are allowed.

.. note:: Most authentication requests made to the Chef server are abstracted from the user. Such as when using knife or the Chef server user interface. In some cases, such as when using the ``knife exec`` subcommand, the authentication requests need to be made more explicitly, but still in a way that does not require authentication headers. In a few cases, such as when using arbitrary Ruby code or cURL, it may be necessary to include the full authentication header as part of the request to the Chef server.

.. end_tag

Header Format
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag api_chef_server_headers_format

All hashing is done using SHA-1 and encoded in Base64. Base64 encoding should have line breaks every 60 characters. Each canonical header should be encoded in the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   Method:HTTP_METHOD
   Hashed Path:HASHED_PATH
   X-Ops-Content-Hash:HASHED_BODY
   X-Ops-Timestamp:TIME
   X-Ops-UserId:USERID

where:

* ``HTTP_METHOD`` is the method used in the API request (``GET``, ``POST``, and so on)
* ``HASHED_PATH`` is the path of the request: ``/organizations/NAME/name_of_endpoint``. The ``HASHED_PATH`` must be hashed using SHA-1 and encoded using Base64, must not have repeated forward slashes (``/``), must not end in a forward slash (unless the path is ``/``), and must not include a query string.
* The private key must be an RSA key in the SSL .pem file format. This signature is then broken into character strings (of not more than 60 characters per line) and placed in the header.

The Chef server decrypts this header and ensures its content matches the content of the non-encrypted headers that were in the request. The timestamp of the message is checked to ensure the request was received within a reasonable amount of time. One approach generating the signed headers is to use `mixlib-authentication <https://github.com/chef/mixlib-authentication>`_, which is a class-based header signing authentication object similar to the one used by the chef-client.

.. end_tag

Required Headers
-----------------------------------------------------
The following authentication headers are required:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 130 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - ``Accept``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_accept

       The format in which response data from the Chef server is provided. This header must be set to ``application/json``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``Content-Type``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_content_type

       The format in which data is sent to the Chef server. This header is required for ``PUT`` and ``POST`` requests and must be set to ``application/json``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``Host``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_host

       The host name (and port number) to which a request is sent. (Port number ``80`` does not need to be specified.) For example: ``api.opscode.com`` (which is the same as ``api.opscode.com:80``) or ``api.opscode.com:443``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Chef-Version``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_chef_version

       The version of the chef-client executable from which a request is made. This header ensures that responses are in the correct format. For example: ``12.0.2`` or ``11.16.x``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Authorization-N``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_authorization

       One (or more) 60 character segments that comprise the canonical header. A canonical header is signed with the private key used by the client machine from which the request is sent, and is also encoded using Base64. If more than one segment is required, each should be named sequentially, e.g. ``X-Ops-Authorization-1``, ``X-Ops-Authorization-2``, ``X-Ops-Authorization-N``, where ``N`` represents the integer used by the last header that is part of the request.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Content-Hash``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_content_hash

       The body of the request. The body should be hashed using SHA-1 and encoded using Base64. All hashing is done using SHA-1 and encoded in Base64. Base64 encoding should have line breaks every 60 characters.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Reporting-Protocol-Version``
     - .. tag api_reporting_headers_x_ops_reporting_protocol_version

       Use to specify the protocol version for the Reporting API. This header must be set to ``0.1.0``.

       * A request to the Chef server API that does not include this header and the correct value will return a 404 response code.
       * A request to the Chef server API that includes this header with an incorrect value will return a 406 reponse code.

       If the protocol version is incorrect (or unspecified), the chef-client run will proceed normally, but Reporting data will not be collected for that chef-client run unless the ``enable_reporting_url_fatals`` setting is ``true`` in the client.rb file for that node.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Sign``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_sign

       Set this header to the following value: ``version=1.0``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Timestamp``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_timestamp

       The timestamp, in ISO-8601 format and with UTC indicated by a trailing ``Z`` and separated by the character ``T``. For example: ``2013-03-10T14:14:44Z``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-UserId``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_userid

       The name of the API client whose private key will be used to create the authorization header.

       .. end_tag
