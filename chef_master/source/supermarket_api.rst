Supermarket API
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/supermarket_api.rst>`__

.. tag supermarket_api_summary

The Supermarket API is used to provide access to cookbooks, tools, and users on the Chef Supermarket at |url supermarket_cookbooks|. All of the cookbooks, tools, and users on the Supermarket are accessible through a RESTful API located at |url supermarket_api| by using any of the supported endpoints. In most cases, using knife is the best way to interact with the Supermarket; in some cases, using the Supermarket API directly is necessary.

.. end_tag
.. note:: In general, using knife (and the ``knife cookbook site`` subcommand) to manage cookbooks that are located on the Cookbooks site is more efficient than using the Supermarket API and is the recommended approach for managing cookbooks on that site. This document provides information about the Supermarket API in the event that using the API is necessary.

Endpoints
=====================================================
The Supermarket API has the following endpoints.

/cookbooks
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag cookbooks_summary

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything that is required to support that scenario:

* Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied
* Attribute values
* File distributions
* Templates
* Extensions to Chef, such as custom resources and libraries

.. end_tag

The ``/cookbooks`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET`` and ``POST``.

POST
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``POST`` method is used to create a new cookbook.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none

   POST /cookbooks/COOKBOOK_NAME

**Response**

The response is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   * - ``200``
     - OK. The request was successful. The cookbook was posted to the Supermarket API.
   * - ``400``
     - The request was unsuccessful. The cookbook was not posted to the Supermarket API. For example:

       .. code-block:: javascript

             ["You're not authorized to upload this cookbook."],
             "error_code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
          }

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to get a listing of the available cookbooks. Use the ``start`` and ``items`` parameters to set limits on the number of cookbooks returned. Use the ``order`` parameter to change the way results are sorted. Use the ``user`` parameter to filter cookbooks by maintainer:

.. tag search

Search indexes allow queries to be made for any type of data that is indexed by the Chef server, including data bags (and data bag items), environments, nodes, and roles. A defined query syntax is used to support search patterns like exact, wildcard, range, and fuzzy. A search is a full-text query that can be done from several locations, including from within a recipe, by using the ``search`` subcommand in knife, the ``search`` method in the Recipe DSL, the search box in the Chef management console, and by using the ``/search`` or ``/search/INDEX`` endpoints in the Chef server API. The search engine is based on Apache Solr and is run from the Chef server.

/universe
-----------------------------------------------------
The universe is the known collection of cookbooks that have been uploaded to Chef Supermarket. The universe is JSON data organized by cookbook, then by cookbook version, and then by a dependency graph that lists each dependency a cookbook version may have on other cookbooks or cookbook versions.

Use the ``/universe`` endpoint to retrieve the known collection of cookbooks, and then use it with Berkshelf.

The ``/universe`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to retrieve the universe data.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none

   GET /universe

**Response**

The response will return an embedded hash, with the name of each cookbook as a top-level key. Each cookbook will list each version, along with its location information and dependencies:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "ffmpeg": {
       "0.1.0": {

/users/USERNAME
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``users/[USERNAME]`` endpoint allows a specific Chef Supermarket user to be accessed. This endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to get the details for a user.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none
