Chef Push Jobs
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/push_jobs.rst>`__

.. tag push_jobs_summary

Chef Push Jobs is an extension of the Chef Infra Server that allows jobs to be run against nodes independently of a Chef Infra Client run. A job is an action or a command to be executed against a subset of nodes; the nodes against which a job is run are determined by the results of a search query made to the Chef Infra Server.

Chef Push Jobs uses the Chef Infra Server API and a Ruby client to initiate all connections to the Chef Infra Server. Connections use the same authentication and authorization model as any other request made to the Chef Infra Server. A knife plugin is used to initiate job creation and job tracking.

.. end_tag

Install `Push Jobs </install_push_jobs.html>`__ using the **push-jobs** cookbook and a Chef Infra Client run on each of the target nodes.

Requirements
=====================================================
Chef Push Jobs has the following requirements:

* An on-premises Chef Server version 11.0.1 (or later); Chef Push Jobs is not supported when running Chef with the hosted Chef server
* To use the **push-jobs** cookbook to configure the Chef Push Jobs client, the Chef Infra Client must also be present on the node (because only the Chef Infra Client can use a cookbook to configure a node)
* .. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_push_jobs

  TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10002. TCP/10000 is the default heartbeat port. TCP/10002 is the command port. It may be configured in the Chef Push Jobs configuration file . This port allows Chef Push Jobs clients to communicate with the Chef Push Jobs server. In a configuration with both front and back ends, this port only needs to be open on the back end servers. The Chef Push Jobs server waits for connections from the Chef Push Jobs client, and never initiates a connection to a Chef Push Jobs client.

  .. end_tag

Components
=====================================================
Chef Push Jobs has three main components: jobs (managed by the Chef Push Jobs server), a client that is installed on every node in the organization, and one (or more) workstations from which job messages are initiated.

All communication between these components is done with the following:

* A heartbeat message between the Chef Push Jobs server and each managed node
* A knife plugin named ``knife push jobs`` with four subcommands: ``job list``, ``job start``, ``job status``, and ``node status``
* Various job messages sent from a workstation to the Chef Push Jobs server
* A single job message that is sent (per job) from the Chef Push Jobs server to one (or more) nodes that are being managed by the Chef server

The following diagram shows the various components of Chef Push Jobs:

.. image:: ../../images/overview_push_jobs_states.png

Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------
The Chef Push Jobs server is used to send job messages to one (or more) managed nodes and also to manage the list of jobs that are available to be run against nodes.

A heartbeat message is used to let all of the nodes in an organization know that the Chef Push Jobs server is available. The Chef Push Jobs server listens for heartbeat messages from each Chef Push Jobs client. If there is no heartbeat from a Chef Push Jobs client, the Chef Push Jobs server will mark that node as unavailable for job messages until the heartbeat resumes.

Nodes
-----------------------------------------------------
The Chef Push Jobs client is used to receive job messages from the Chef Push Jobs server and to verify the heartbeat status. The Chef Push Jobs client uses the same authorization / authentication model as the Chef Infra Client. The Chef Push Jobs client listens for heartbeat messages from the Chef Push Jobs server. If there is no heartbeat from the Chef Push Jobs server, the Chef Push Jobs client will finish its current job, but then stop accepting any new jobs until the heartbeat from the Chef Push Jobs server resumes.

Workstations
-----------------------------------------------------
A workstation is used to manage Chef Push Jobs jobs, including maintaining the **push-jobs** cookbook, using knife to start and stop jobs, view job status, and to manage job lists.

**push-jobs** Cookbook
=====================================================
The **push-jobs** cookbook contains attributes that are used to configure the Chef Push Jobs client. In addition, Chef Push Jobs relies on the ``whitelist`` attribute to manage the list of jobs (and commands) that are available to Chef Push Jobs.

Whitelist
-----------------------------------------------------
A whitelist is a list of jobs and commands that are used by Chef Push Jobs. A whitelist is saved as an attribute in the **push-jobs** cookbook. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default['push_jobs']['whitelist'] = {
     'job_name' => 'command',
   }

The whitelist is accessed from a recipe using the ``node['push_jobs']['whitelist']`` attribute. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template 'name' do
     source 'name'
     ...
     variables(:whitelist => node['push_jobs']['whitelist'])
   end

Use the ``knife exec`` subcommand to add a job to the whitelist. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("name:A_NODE_NAME") do |n|
       n.set["push_jobs"]["whitelist"]["ntpdate"] = "ntpdate -u time"
     end'

where ``["ntpdate"] = "ntpdate -u time"`` is added to the whitelist:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default['push_jobs']['whitelist'] = {
     "ntpdate" => "ntpdate -u time",
   }

Reference
=====================================================
The following sections describe the knife subcommands, the Push Jobs API, and configuration settings used by Chef Push Jobs.

knife push jobs
=====================================================
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_summary

The ``knife push jobs`` subcommand is used by Chef Push Jobs to start jobs, view job status, view job lists, and view node status.

.. end_tag

.. note:: Review the list of `common options </knife_options.html>`__ available to this (and all) knife subcommands and plugins.

job list
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_list

Use the ``job list`` argument to view a list of Chef Push Jobs jobs.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_list_syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job list

.. end_tag

Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This command does not have any specific options.

job start
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start

Use the ``job start`` argument to start a Chef Push Jobs job.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start_syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job start (options) COMMAND [NODE, NODE, ...]

.. end_tag

Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This argument has the following options:

``--timeout TIMEOUT``
   The maximum amount of time (in seconds) by which a job must complete, before it is stopped.

``-q QUORUM``, ``--quorum QUORUM``
   The minimum number of nodes that match the search criteria, are available, and acknowledge the job request. This can be expressed as a percentage (e.g. ``50%``) or as an absolute number of nodes (e.g. ``145``). Default value: ``100%``.

   For example, there are ten total nodes. If ``--quorum 80%`` is used and eight of those nodes acknowledge the job request, the command will be run against all of the available nodes. If two of the nodes were unavailable, the command would still be run against the remaining eight available nodes because quorum was met.

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
**Run a job**

.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start_run_job

To run a job named ``add-glasses`` against a node named ``ricardosalazar``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job start add-glasses 'ricardosalazar'

.. end_tag

**Run a job using quorum percentage**

.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start_search_by_quorum

To search for nodes assigned the role ``webapp``, and where 90% of those nodes must be available, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job start --quorum 90% 'chef-client' --search 'role:webapp'

.. end_tag

**Run a job using node names**

.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start_search_by_nodes

To search for a specific set of nodes (named ``chico``, ``harpo``, ``groucho``, ``gummo``, ``zeppo``), and where 90% of those nodes must be available, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job start --quorum 90% 'chef-client' chico harpo groucho gummo zeppo

to return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Started. Job ID: GUID12345abc
     quorum_failed
     Command: chef-client
     Created_at: date
     unavailable: zeppo

       gummo
       groucho
       chico
       harpo
     On_timeout: 3600
     Status: quorum_failed

.. note:: If quorum had been set at 80% (``--quorum 80%``), then quorum would have passed with the previous example.

.. end_tag

Push Jobs API
=====================================================
The Push Jobs API is used to create jobs and retrieve status using Chef Push Jobs, a tool that pushes jobs against a set of nodes in the organization. All requests are signed using the Chef Infra Server API and the validation key on the workstation from which the requests are made. All commands are sent to the Chef Infra Server using the ``knife exec`` subcommand.

Each authentication request must include ``/organizations/organization_name/pushy/`` as part of the name for the endpoint. For example: ``/organizations/organization_name/pushy/jobs/ID`` or ``/organizations/organization_name/pushy/node_states``.
