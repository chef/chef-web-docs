.. important:: The new compliance functionality described in this topic is currently in Beta. To enable compliance reporting in the Chef Automate UI, navigate to the **Nodes** tab, make sure your cursor is not in any text box or field, and type ``beta``. A new ``Compliance`` tab should appear in the top-level menu of the UI. Note: Enabling the ``Compliance`` tab will allow you to view only new compliance scan data, not historical data.

   While we encourage customers to try out this new functionality, the new compliance features are not recommended for production use until they are made generally available in an upcoming Chef Automate release.

The **Compliance** tab in your Chef Automate cluster allows you to upload, search, and view the profiles on your Chef Automate server, as well as the ability to filter on the compliance status of the nodes in your cluster. You can pivot your reports based on either the nodes or the profiles you have executed against those nodes. 

Filter your report data
==============================================

To begin viewing and filtering your reports, click the **Compliance** tab at the top of the Chef Automate UI and then click **Reporting** on the left pane.

You can filter by Profile, Control, Node, Platform, Environment, or a combination of these categories when you are in either the **Node Status** or **Profile Status** views.

To clear a filter, simply click on the filter icon and remove the filter or clear all filtering.

Switching views
===============================================

In addition to filtering your reporting data, you can also switch your views to either see profiles and test results on a per-node basis, or see how your cluster of nodes behaves according to a profile.
