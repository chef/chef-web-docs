.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

The **Compliance** tab in your Chef Automate cluster allows you to upload, search, and view the profiles on your Chef Automate server, as well as the ability to filter on the compliance status of the nodes in your cluster. You can pivot your reports based on either the nodes or the profiles you have executed against those nodes. 

Filter your report data
==============================================

To begin viewing and filtering your reports, click the **Compliance** tab at the top of the Chef Automate UI and then click **Reporting** on the left pane.

You can filter by Profile, Control, Node, Platform, Environment, or a combination of these categories when you are in either the **Node Status** or **Profile Status** views.

===============================================

To clear a filter, simply click on the filter icon and remove the filter or clear all filtering.
