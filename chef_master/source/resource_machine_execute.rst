.. warning:: .. tag notes_provisioning

             This functionality was available with Chef provisioning and was packaged in the Chef development kit.

             Chef Provisioning is no longer included with Chef DK, and will be officially end of life on August 31, 2019.  The source code of Chef Provisioning and the drivers have been moved into the chef-boneyard organization. Current users of Chef Provisioning should contact your Chef Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to review your options.

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag resource_machine_execute_syntax

The syntax for using the **machine_execute** resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   machine_execute 'name' do
     attribute 'value' # see properties section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where

* ``machine_execute`` tells the Chef Infra Client to use the ``Chef::Provider::MachineExecute`` provider during the Chef Infra Client run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``command`` property is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the command to be run
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available for this resource
* ``action`` identifies which steps the Chef Infra Client will take to bring the node into the desired state

.. end_tag
