windows_feature_powershell
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_windows_feature_powershell.rst>`__

Use the **windows_feature_powershell** resource to add, remove or entirely delete Windows features and roles using PowerShell. This resource offers significant speed benefits over the `windows_feature_dism </resource_windows_feature_dism.html>`__ resource, but requires installation of the Remote Server Administration Tools on non-server releases of Windows.

**New in Chef Client 14.0.**

Syntax
=====================================================
This resource has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_feature_powershell 'name' do
     all                        true, false # default value: 'false'
     feature_name               Array, String # default value: 'name'
     management_tools           true, false # default value: 'false'
     notifies                   # see description
     source                     String
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    Integer # default value: '600'
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
   end

where:

* ``windows_feature_powershell`` is the resource
* ``'name'`` is the name of the feature / role, or the name of the resource block
* ``all``, ``feature_name``, ``management_tools``, ``notifies``, ``source``, ``subscribes``, and ``timeout`` are the properties available to this resource

Actions
=====================================================
``:install``
   Default. Install a Windows role / feature using PowerShell.

``:remove``
   Remove a Windows role / feature using PowerShell.

``:delete``
   Delete a Windows role / feature from the image using PowerShell.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
``all``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Install all subfeatures. When set to ``true``, this is the equivalent of specifying the ``-InstallAllSubFeatures`` switch with ``Add-WindowsFeature``.

``feature_name``
   **Ruby Type:** Array, String | **Default Value:** ``'name'``

   The name of the feature(s) or role(s) to install, if it differs from the resource block name.

``management_tools``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Install all applicable management tools for the roles, role services, or features.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Specify a local repository for the feature install.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``600``

   Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for the feature installation.
