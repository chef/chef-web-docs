The Chef Automate server includes a command-line utility named `automate-ctl`. Use this command-line tool to:

* Manage enterprises, users, and projects
* Reconfigure the Chef Automate server
* Start and stop individual services
* Tail Chef Automate server log files

.. note:: All commands must be run as ``sudo``.

.. tag delivery_ctl_note

.. note:: Prior to Chef Automate 0.6.0, this tool was named `delivery-ctl`. To support backwards compatibility, you can continue to call `delivery-ctl` in Chef Automate 0.6.0.

The ``uninstall`` subcommand is used to remove the Chef Automate application, but without removing any of the data. This subcommand will shut down all services (including the ``runit`` process supervisor).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl uninstall

.. note:: To revert the ``uninstall`` subcommand, run the ``reconfigure`` subcommand (because the ``start`` subcommand is disabled by the ``uninstall`` command).

update-project-hooks
=====================================================
The ``update-project-hooks`` subcommand is used to update git hooks for all projects.

**Syntax**

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl update-project-hooks ENT_NAME ORG_NAME PROJECT_NAME

Service Subcommands
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_common_service_subcommands

This command has a built in process supervisor that ensures all of the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service and provides the following subcommands for managing services: ``hup``, ``int``, ``kill``, ``once``, ``restart``, ``service-list``, ``start``, ``status``, ``stop``, ``tail``, and ``term``.

.. end_tag

graceful-kill
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``kill`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGKILL`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl kill name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

hup
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``hup`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGHUP`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl hup name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

int
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``int`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGINT`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl int name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

kill
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``kill`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGKILL`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl kill name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

once
-----------------------------------------------------
The supervisor for the Chef Automate server is configured to restart any service that fails, unless that service has been asked to change its state. The ``once`` subcommand is used to tell the supervisor to not attempt to restart any service that fails.

This command is useful when troubleshooting configuration errors that prevent a service from starting. Run the ``once`` subcommand followed by the ``status`` subcommand to look for services in a down state and/or to identify which services are in trouble. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl once name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

restart
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``restart`` subcommand is used to restart all services enabled on the Chef Automate server or to restart an individual service by specifying the name of that service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl restart name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully restarted the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

service-list
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``service-list`` subcommand is used to display a list of all available services. A service that is enabled is labeled with an asterisk (*).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl service-list

start
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``start`` subcommand is used to start all services that are enabled in the Chef Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl start name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully started the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

The supervisor for the Chef Automate server is configured to wait seven seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If you see output that references a timeout, it means that a signal has been sent to the process, but that the process has yet to actually comply. In general, processes that have timed out are not a big concern, unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all. If a process is not responding, use a command like the ``kill`` subcommand to stop the process, investigate the cause (if required), and then use the ``start`` subcommand to re-enable it.

status
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``status`` subcommand is used to show the status of all services available to the Chef Automate server. The results will vary based on the configuration of a given server. This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl status

and will return the status for all services. Status can be returned for individual services by specifying the name of the service as part of the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl status name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

When service status is requested, the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ run: service_name: (pid 12345) 12345s; run: log: (pid 1234) 67890s

where

* ``run:`` is the state of the service (``run:`` or ``down:``)
* ``service_name:`` is the name of the service for which status is returned
* ``(pid 12345)`` is the process identifier
* ``12345s`` is the uptime of the service, in seconds

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ down: opscode-erchef: (pid 35546) 10s

By default, runit will restart services automatically when the services fail. Therefore, runit may report the status of a service as ``run:`` even when there is an issue with that service. When investigating why a particular service is not running as it should be, look for the services with the shortest uptimes. For example, the list below indicates that the **opscode-erchef** should be investigated further:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: oc-id
   run: opscode-chef: (pid 4327) 13671s; run: log: (pid 4326) 13671s
   run: opscode-erchef: (pid 5383) 5s; run: log: (pid 4382) 13669s
   run: opscode-expander: (pid 4078) 13694s; run: log: (pid 4077) 13694s
   run: opscode-expander-reindexer: (pid 4130) 13692s; run: log: (pid 4114) 13692s

Log Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A typical status line for a service that is running any of the Chef Automate server front-end services is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s

where:

* ``run`` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep processes. This state is either ``run`` or ``down``. If a service is in a ``down`` state, it should be stopped
* ``name_of_service`` is the service name, for example: ``opscode-solr4``
* ``(pid 1486) 7819s;`` is the process identifier followed by the amount of time (in seconds) the service has been running
* ``run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s`` is the log process. It is typical for a log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   down: opscode-solr4: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s

where

* ``down`` indicates that the service is in a down state
* ``3s, normally up;`` indicates that the service is normally in a run state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service after a reboot

stop
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``stop`` subcommand is used to stop all services enabled on the Chef Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl stop name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully stopped the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: diwb: service_name: 0s, normally up

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl stop

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   ok: down: nginx: 393s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-chef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-erchef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander: 390s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander-reindexer: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-solr4: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: postgresql: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: rabbitmq: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: redis_lb: 387s, normally up

tail
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``tail`` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef Automate server logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl tail name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

term
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``term`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGTERM`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ automate-ctl term name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

usr1
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``usr1`` subcommand is used to send the services a USR1.

usr2
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``usr2`` subcommand is used to send the services a USR2.
