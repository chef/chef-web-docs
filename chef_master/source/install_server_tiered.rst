This topic describes how to set up the Chef server with a single back end and multiple load-balanced frontend servers.

.. image:: ../../images/chef_server_tiered.png

Prerequisites
=====================================================
Before installing the Chef server software, perform the following steps:

* The backend server must be accessible from each frontend server. A virtual IP address is created and managed by the Chef server, but will also need to be added to the DNS so that all machines in the tiered configuration may access it.
* Persistent data on the backend Chef server is primarily composed of cookbook files and directories. Separate disks should be dedicated entirely to storing this data prior to installing the Chef server.
* Load-balancing should be used with frontend servers, along with a DNS entry for the virtual IP address used for load balancing. This virtual IP address is added to the chef-server.rb file as the ``api_fqdn``.
* All required ports must be open. See the Firewalls section (below) for the list of ports. All connections to and from the Chef server are accomplished via TCP. Refer to the operating system's manual or your systems administrators for instructions on how to configure to ports, if necessary.
* The hostname for the Chef server must be an FQDN, including the domain suffix, and must be resolvable by the backend and frontend servers. See `Hostnames, FQDNs </install_server_pre.html#hostnames>`_ for more information.
* ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` will not bind the ``backend_vip`` to the backend server. The easiest thing to do is just define ``backend_vip`` as the already configured main IP address of the backend system. If you need to use an additional address, it will need to be configured and bound on the system before ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` is run.

Basic Hardware Requirements
=====================================================
For a tiered deployment, your backend server should support the following hardware requirements:

* 64-bit architecture
* 8 total cores (physical or virtual)
* 16GB RAM
* Fast, redundant storage (SSD/RAID-based solution)

  * 50 GB/backend server (SSD if on premises, Premium Storage in Microsoft Azure, EBS-Optimized GP2 in AWS)

* 1 GigE NIC interface
* A back-end server; all other systems will be front-end servers.

Disk Configuration
=====================================================
Persistent data on the backend server of the Chef server is primarily composed of cookbook files and directories. Separate disks should be dedicated entirely to storing this data prior to installing the Chef server. These disks should be part of a SSD or hardware RAID-based solution that ensure redundancy and high IOPS. This configuration guide assumes that:

* ~50GB of raw, unpartitioned disk space is available. Disk space should scale up with the number of nodes that the backend server is managing. A good rule to follow is to allocate 2 MB per node.
* The disk space presents as a single device. For example: ``/dev/sdb``.
* The storage is added to a volume group named ``opscode`` and is presented to the Chef server by mounting on ``/var/opt/opscode`` before a reconfiguration

The following commands properly set up disk configuration on the backend server:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pvcreate /dev/sdb

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ vgcreate opscode /dev/sdb

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ lvcreate -l 80%VG -n tiered opscode

Mount Storage Device
-----------------------------------------------------
To build and mount the storage device on the backend server, do the following:

#. Create the file system. For example, an ``ext4`` type named ``tiered``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/opscode/tiered

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mkdir -p /var/opt/opscode

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mount /dev/opscode/tiered /var/opt/opscode

Backend
=====================================================
Use the following steps to set up the backend Chef server:

#. Download the packages from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed.

#. Create a file named chef-server.rb that is located in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory. See the chef-server.rb section below for an example of the settings and values that are required.

chef-server.rb
=====================================================
The chef-server.rb file that is located in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory describes the topology of the tiered configuration. On the backend server, create a file named chef-server.rb and save it in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory.

Add the following settings to the chef-server.rb file:

#. Define the topology type:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      topology "tier"

#. Define the backend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "backend",
        :bootstrap => true

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the server and ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server. The role is a backend server is ``"backend"``.

#. Define the backend virtual IP address:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      backend_vip "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :device => "eth0"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the server. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the virtual IP address of the server. The ``:device`` parameter should be the ethernet interface to which the virtual IP address will bind. This is typically the public interface of the server. In a typical tiered install, the config here could also be just the main FQDN and IP address that are already configured for the backend. Running ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` will not bind the ``backend_vip`` address to an interface, this must be done on startup of the machine.

#. Define each frontend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "frontend"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the frontend server. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the frontend server. Set ``:role`` to ``"frontend"``.

   Add separate entry in the chef-server.rb file for each frontend server.

#. Define the API FQDN:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      api_fqdn "FQDN"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the load balanced virtual IP address, which should be equal to the FQDN for the service URI that is used by the Chef server.

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

Frontend
=====================================================
For each frontend server, use the following steps to set up the Chef server:

#. Install the Chef server package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed.

#. Create the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory, and then copy the entire contents of the ``/etc/opscode`` directory from the primary backend server, including all certificates and the chef-server.rb file.

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

#. .. tag install_chef_server_start

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Start the Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl start

   .. end_tag

On a single frontend server, create an administrator and an organization:

#. .. tag ctl_chef_server_user_create_admin

   Run the following command to create an administrator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl user-create USER_NAME FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME EMAIL 'PASSWORD' --filename FILE_NAME

   An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the user's private key and should be saved to a safe location. The ``--filename`` option will save the RSA private key to the specified absolute path.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl user-create janedoe Jane Doe janed@example.com 'abc123' --filename /path/to/janedoe.pem

   .. end_tag

#. .. tag ctl_chef_server_org_create_summary

   Run the following command to create an organization:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl org-create short_name 'full_organization_name' --association_user user_name --filename ORGANIZATION-validator.pem

   For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl org-create 4thcoffee 'Fourth Coffee, Inc.' --association_user janedoe --filename /path/to/4thcoffee-validator.pem

   The name must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 1 and 255 characters. For example: ``4thcoffee``.

   The full name must begin with a non-white space character and must be between 1 and 1023 characters. For example: ``'Fourth Coffee, Inc.'``.

   The ``--association_user`` option will associate the ``user_name`` with the ``admins`` security group on the Chef server.

   An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the chef-validator key and should be saved to a safe location. The ``--filename`` option will save the RSA private key to the specified absolute path.

   .. end_tag

Enable Features
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features

Enable additional features of the Chef server! The packages may be downloaded directly as part of the installation process or they may be first downloaded to a local directory, and then installed.

.. end_tag

**Use Downloads**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_download_ha

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are not behind a firewall (and have connectivity to https://packages.chef.io/), the Chef management console package can be installed as described below:

Chef Manage
   Use Chef management console to manage data bags, attributes, run-lists, roles, environments, and cookbooks from a web user interface.

   On each front end server in the Chef server configuration, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install chef-manage

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-manage-ctl reconfigure

   This updates the Chef server and creates the ``/etc/opscode-manage/secrets.rb`` file. When running the Chef management console 1.11 (or higher), copy the ``secrets.rb`` file in the ``/etc/opscode-manage`` directory on one of the frontend servers to the same directory on each of the other frontend servers, and then rerun ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` so the copied ``/etc/opscode-manage/secrets.rb`` file gets used correctly.

   .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_manage

             Starting with the Chef management console 2.3.0, the `Chef MLSA </chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

             .. end_tag

.. end_tag

**Use Local Packages**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_manual

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are behind a firewall (and may not have connectivity to packages.chef.io), these packages can be downloaded from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-manage/, and then installed manually. First download the package that is appropriate for the platform, save it to a local path, and then run the ``install`` command using the ``--path`` option to specify the directory in which the package is located:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install PACKAGE_NAME --path /path/to/package/directory

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install chef-manage --path /root/packages

The ``chef-server-ctl`` command will install the first ``chef-manage`` package found in the ``/root/packages`` directory.

.. end_tag

**Install Reporting**

.. tag install_reporting_ha

To set up the Reporting server:

#. Install the package on each frontend and backend Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install opscode-reporting

#. Reconfigure the Chef server on the backend primary server (bootstrap):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Reconfigure the Reporting server on the backend primary server (bootstrap):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure

   .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_reporting

             Starting with Reporting 1.6.0, the `Chef MLSA </chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

             .. end_tag

#. Copy the entire ``/etc/opscode-reporting`` directory from the backend primary server to all frontend and backend servers. For example, from each server run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r <Bootstrap server IP>:/etc/opscode-reporting /etc

   or from the backend primary server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r /etc/opscode-reporting <each servers IP>:/etc

#. Reconfigure any Chef server on which Reporting services have been installed:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Reconfigure Reporting services on each server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl test

.. end_tag

   server "fe3.example.com",
     :ipaddress => "192.168.4.4",
     :role => "frontend"

   api_fqdn "chef.example.com"

Firewalls
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_summary

All of the ports used by the Chef server are TCP ports. Refer to the operating system's manual or site systems administrators for instructions on how to enable changes to ports, if necessary.

.. end_tag

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_listening

All services must be listening on the appropriate ports. Most monitoring systems provide a means of testing whether a given port is accepting connections and service-specific tools may also be available. In addition, the generic system tool Telnet can also be used to initiate the connection:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ telnet HOST_NAME PORT

.. end_tag

.. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_loopback

A single loopback interface should be configured using the ``127.0.0.1`` address. This ensures that all of the services are available to the Chef server, in the event that the Chef server attempts to contact itself from within a front or back end machine. All ports should be accessible through the loopback interface of their respective hosts.

.. end_tag

Backend
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
