.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

Automatic Node Run Data Collection with Chef Server
=======================================================

.. note:: Requires Chef Client 12.16.42 or greater, and Chef server 12.11.0 or greater.

Nodes can send their run data to Chef Automate through the Chef server automatically. To enable this functionality, you must perform the following steps:

 * `Configure a Data Collector token in Chef Automate </data_collection.html#step-1-configure-a-data-collector-token-in-chef-automate>`__
 * `Configure your Chef server to point to Chef Automate <https://docs.chef.io/data_collection.html#step-2-configure-your-chef-server-to-point-to-chef-automate>`__

Multiple Chef servers can send data to a single Chef Automate server.

Step 1: Configure a Data Collector token in Chef Automate
------------------------------------------------------------

All messages sent to Chef Automate are performed over HTTP and are authenticated with a pre-shared key called a ``token``. Every Chef Automate installation configures a token by default, but we strongly recommend that you create your own.

.. note:: The Data Collector token has no minimum or maximum character length restrictions. While the UTF-8 character set is supported, `US-ASCII <http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ascii.html>`__ is recommended for best results.

To set your own token, add the following to your ``/etc/delivery/delivery.rb`` file:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      data_collector['token'] = 'sometokenvalue'
      # Save and close the file

To apply the changes, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo automate-ctl reconfigure


If you do not configure a token, the default token value is: ``93a49a4f2482c64126f7b6015e6b0f30284287ee4054ff8807fb63d9cbd1c506``

Step 2: Configure your Chef server to point to Chef Automate
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to forwarding Chef run data to Automate, Chef server will send messages to Chef Automate whenever an action is taken on a Chef server object, such as when a cookbook is uploaded to the Chef server or when a user edits a role.

.. warning:: If running chef-client releases prior to Chef 14, please disable the Ohai Passwd and Sessions plugins on your nodes in ``/etc/chef/client.rb`` or using the chef-client cookbook to keep the data sent to your Automate system to a minimum. This improves search performance and reduces disk space requirements.

   .. code-block:: shell

      ohai.disabled_plugins = [ :Passwd, :Sessions ]

`Ohai Plugin Detail </ohai.html#ohai-settings-in-client-rb>`__

Setting up data collection on Chef server versions 12.14 and higher
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Channel the token setting through the veil secrets library because the token is considered a secret, and cannot appear in ``/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb``:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo chef-server-ctl set-secret data_collector token 'TOKEN'
      sudo chef-server-ctl restart nginx
      sudo chef-server-ctl restart opscode-erchef

Then add the following setting to ``/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb`` on the Chef server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      data_collector['root_url'] = 'https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com/data-collector/v0/'
      # Add for compliance scanning
      profiles['root_url'] = 'https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com'
      # Save and close the file

To apply the changes, run:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      chef-server-ctl reconfigure


where ``my-automate-server.mycompany.com`` is the fully-qualified domain name of your Chef Automate server.

Setting up data collection on Chef server versions 12.13 and lower
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On versions 12.13 and prior, simply add the ``'root_url'`` and ``token`` values in ``/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb``:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      data_collector['root_url'] = 'https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com/data-collector/v0/'
      data_collector['token'] = 'TOKEN'
      # Add for compliance scanning
      profiles['root_url'] = 'https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com'
      # Save and close the file

To apply the changes, run:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      chef-server-ctl reconfigure


where ``my-automate-server.mycompany.com`` is the fully-qualified domain name of your Chef Automate server, and
``TOKEN`` is either the default value or the token value you configured in the `prior section <#configure-a-data-collector-token-in-chef-automate>`__.

Use an external Elasticsearch cluster (optional)
=====================================================

Chef Automate uses Elasticsearch to store its data, and the default Chef Automate install includes a single Elasticsearch service.
This is sufficient to run production workloads; however, for greater data retention, we recommend using a multi-node Elasticsearch cluster with replication and sharding to store and protect your data.

As of Automate 1.7.114, the compliance service uses a ``compliance-latest`` Elasticsearch index to improves the performance of the reporting APIs at scale. Automate creates this index automatically as part of the upgrade to Automate 1.7.114. The index is updated with each new compliance report.  If the ``compliance-latest`` Elasticsearch index becomes out of sync with the time-series data, it can be regenerated using the ``automate-ctl migrate-compliance`` subcommand.  For more information, see `migrate-compliance </ctl_automate_server.html#migrate-compliance>`__.

Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------

* Chef Automate server
* Elasticsearch (version 2.4.1 or greater; version 5.x is required for Chef Automate 1.6 and above)

Elasticsearch configuration
-----------------------------------------------------

To utilize an external Elasticsearch installation, set the following configuration option in your
``/etc/delivery/delivery.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  elasticsearch['urls'] = ['https://my-elasticsearch-cluster.mycompany.com']

Or for a three node on premise install

.. code-block:: ruby

  elasticsearch['urls'] = ['http://172.16.0.100:9200', 'http://172.16.0.101:9200', 'http://172.16.0.100:9202']

The ``elasticsearch['urls']`` attribute should be an array of Elasticsearch nodes over
which Chef Automate will round-robin requests. You can also supply a single entry which corresponds to
a load-balancer or a third-party Elasticsearch-as-a-service offering.

After saving the file, run ``sudo automate-ctl reconfigure``.

An additional Elasticsearch option is ``elasticsearch['host_header']``. This is the HTTP ``Host`` header to send with the request.
When this attribute is unspecified, the default behavior is as follows:

 * If the ``urls`` parameter contains a single entry, the host of the supplied URI will be sent as the Host header.
 * If the ``urls`` parameter contains more than one entry, no Host header will be  sent.

When this attribute **is** specified, the supplied string will be sent as the ``Host`` header on all requests. This may be required for some third-party Elasticsearch offerings.


Troubleshooting: My data does not show up in the UI
=====================================================

.. tag chef_automate_visibility_no_data_troubleshoot

If an organization does not have any nodes associated with it, it does not show up in the **Nodes** section of the Chef Automate UI.
This is also true for roles, cookbooks, recipes, attributes, resources, node names, and environments. Only those items that have a node associated with them will appear in the UI. Chef Automate has all the data for all of these, but does not highlight them in the UI. This is designed to keep the UI focused on the nodes in your cluster.
