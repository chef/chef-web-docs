Compliance
======================================================

Chef Automate 1.5.46 or later provides an easy way to view how successful the nodes in your infrastructure are at meeting the compliance requirements specified by your organization. Several built-in profiles are included in Chef Automate to scan for security risks, outdated software, and more. These profiles cover a variety of security frameworks, such as Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks. If you have additional compliance requirements, you can also write your own compliance profiles in InSpec and upload them to Chef Automate. For more information how to view the compliance status across your cluster, see `Compliance Overview </chef_automate_compliance.html>`__.
