.. tag resource_script_perl

Use the **perl** resource to execute scripts using the Perl interpreter. This resource may also use any of the actions and properties that are available to the **execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. note:: The **perl** script resource (which is based on the **script** resource) is different from the **ruby_block** resource because Ruby code that is run with this resource is created as a temporary file and executed like other script resources, rather than run inline.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
A **perl** resource block executes scripts Perl:

.. code-block:: perl

   perl 'hello world' do
     code <<-EOH
       print "Hello world! From Chef and Perl.";
       EOH
   end

where

* ``code`` specifies the command to run

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **perl** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   perl 'name' do
     code                       String
     creates                    String
     cwd                        String
     environment                Hash
     flags                      String
     group                      String, Integer
     notifies                   # see description
     path                       Array
     returns                    Integer, Array
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    Integer, Float
     user                       String, Integer
     umask                      String, Integer
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :run if not specified
   end

where:

* ``perl`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``code``, ``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``flags``, ``group``, ``path``, ``returns``, ``timeout``, ``user``, and ``umask`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

Actions
=====================================================

The perl resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``
   Prevent a command from running. This action is used to specify that a command is run only when another resource notifies it.

``:run``
   Default. Run a script.

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

``creates``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.

``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The current working directory.

``environment``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A Hash of environment variables in the form of ``({"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"})``. (These variables must exist for a command to be run successfully.)

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One or more command line flags that are passed to the interpreter when a command is invoked.

``group``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a command.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``path``
   **Ruby Type:** Array

   An array of paths to use when searching for a command. These paths are not added to the command's environment $PATH. The default value uses the system path.

   .. warning:: .. tag resources_common_resource_execute_attribute_path

                The ``path`` property has been deprecated and will throw an exception in Chef Client 12 or later. We recommend you use the ``environment`` property instead.

                .. end_tag

      For example:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         perl 'mycommand' do
           environment 'PATH' => "/my/path/to/bin:#{ENV['PATH']}"
         end

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``returns``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The return value for a command. This may be an array of accepted values. An exception is raised when the return value(s) do not match.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Float | **Default Value:** ``3600``

   The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing out.

``user``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   The user name or user ID that should be changed before running a command.

``umask``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   The file mode creation mask, or umask.

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of the chef-client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell the chef-client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for the chef-client to do nothing.

.. end_tag

**Attributes**

.. tag resources_common_guards_attributes

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of the chef-client run:

``not_if``
   Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
   Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag

**Arguments**

.. tag resources_common_guards_arguments

The following arguments can be used with the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` guard properties:

``:user``
   Specify the user that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :user => 'adam'

``:group``
   Specify the group that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :group => 'adam'

``:environment``
   Specify a Hash of environment variables to be set. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :environment => {
        'HOME' => '/home/adam'
      }

``:cwd``
   Set the current working directory before running a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam passwd', :cwd => '/etc'

``:timeout``
   Set a timeout for a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'sleep 10000', :timeout => 10

.. end_tag
