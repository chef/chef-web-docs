Chef for Microsoft Windows
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/windows.rst>`__

The chef-client has specific components that are designed to support unique aspects of the Microsoft Windows platform, including Windows PowerShell, Internet Information Services (IIS), and SQL Server.

* The chef-client is `installed on a machine <https://downloads.chef.io/chef>`_ running Microsoft Windows by using a Microsoft Installer Package (MSI)
* Over a dozen resources dedicated to the Microsoft Windows platform are built into the chef-client.
* Use the **dsc_resource** to use PowerShell DSC resources in Chef!
* Two knife plugins dedicated to the Microsoft Windows platform are available: ``knife azure`` is used to manage virtual instances in Microsoft Azure; ``knife windows`` is used to interact with and manage physical nodes that are running Microsoft Windows, such as desktops and servers
* Many community cookbooks on Supermarket provide Windows specific support. Chef maintains cookbooks for `PowerShell <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/powershell>`_, `IIS <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/iis>`_, `SQL Server <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/database>`_, and `Windows <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows>`_.
* Two community provisioners for Kitchen: `kitchen-dsc <https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-dsc>`_ and `kitchen-pester <https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-pester>`_

The most popular core resources in the chef-client---`cookbook_file </resource_cookbook_file.html>`__, `directory </resource_directory.html>`__, `env </resource_env.html>`__, `execute </resource_execute.html>`__, `file </resource_file.html>`__, `group </resource_group.html>`__, `http_request </resource_http_request.html>`__, `link </resource_link.html>`__, `mount </resource_mount.html>`__, `package </resource_package.html>`__, `remote_directory </resource_remote_directory.html>`__, `remote_file </resource_remote_file.html>`__, `ruby_block </resource_ruby_block.html>`__, `service </resource_service.html>`__, `template </resource_template.html>`__, and `user </resource_user.html>`__---work the same way in Microsoft Windows as they do on any UNIX- or Linux-based platform.

The file-based resources---**cookbook_file**, **file**, **remote_file**, and **template**---have attributes that support unique requirements within the Microsoft Windows platform, including ``inherits`` (for file inheritance), ``mode`` (for octal modes), and ``rights`` (for access control lists, or ACLs).

.. note:: The Microsoft Windows platform does not support running as an alternate user unless full credentials (a username and password or equivalent) are specified.

The following sections are pulled in from the larger |url docs| site and represents the documentation that is specific to the Microsoft Windows platform, compiled here into a single-page reference.

Install the chef-client on Windows
=====================================================
.. tag windows_install_overview

The chef-client can be installed on machines running Microsoft Windows in the following ways:

* By using `knife windows </knife_windows.html>`__ to bootstrap the chef-client; this process requires the target node be available via the WinRM port (typically port 5985)
* By downloading the chef-client to the target node, and then running the Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) locally
* By using an existing process already in place for managing Microsoft Windows machines, such as System Center

To run the chef-client at periodic intervals (so that it can check in with the Chef server automatically), configure the chef-client to run as a service or as a scheduled task. (The chef-client can be configured to run as a service during the setup process.)

.. end_tag

The chef-client can be used to manage machines that run on the following versions of Microsoft Windows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 200 200
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operating System
     - Version
     - Architecture
   * - Windows
     - 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016
     - x86_64

(The recommended amount of RAM available to the chef-client during a chef-client run is 512MB. Each node and workstation must have access to the Chef server via HTTPS.)

The Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) for Microsoft Windows is available at https://downloads.chef.io/chef.

After the chef-client is installed, it is located at ``C:\chef``. The main configuration file for the chef-client is located at ``C:\chef\client.rb``.

Set the System Ruby
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_set_system_ruby

To set the system Ruby for the Microsoft Windows platform `the steps described for all platforms are true </install_dk.html#set-system-ruby>`_, but then require the following manual edits to the ``chef shell-init bash`` output for the Microsoft Windows platform:

#. Add quotes around the variable assignment strings.
#. Convert ``C:/`` to ``/c/``.
#. Save those changes.

.. end_tag

Spaces and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_spaces_and_directories

Directories that are used by Chef on Windows cannot have spaces. For example, ``C:\Users\Steven Danno`` will not work, but ``C:\Users\StevenDanno`` will. Because of this, the ``knife supermarket install`` subcommand will fail if the directory contains a space.

.. end_tag

Top-level Directory Names
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_top_level_directory_names

Windows will throw errors when path name lengths are too long. For this reason, it's often helpful to use a very short top-level directory, much like what is done in UNIX and Linux. For example, Chef uses ``/opt/`` to install the Chef development kit on macOS. A similar approach can be done on Microsoft Windows, by creating a top-level directory with a short name. For example: ``C:\chef``.

.. end_tag

Use knife-windows
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag knife_windows_summary

The ``knife windows`` subcommand is used to configure and interact with nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running Microsoft Windows. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows native objects---batch scripts, Windows PowerShell scripts, or scripting library variables---to be called by external applications. The ``knife windows`` subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of authentication.

.. end_tag

For more information about the ``knife windows`` plugin, see `windows </knife_windows.html>`__.

Ports
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag knife_windows_winrm_ports

WinRM requires that a target node be accessible via the ports configured to support access via HTTP or HTTPS.

.. end_tag

Msiexec.exe
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag windows_msiexec

Msiexec.exe is used to install the chef-client on a node as part of a bootstrap operation. The actual command that is run by the default bootstrap script is:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ msiexec /qn /i "%LOCAL_DESTINATION_MSI_PATH%"

where ``/qn`` is used to set the user interface level to "No UI", ``/i`` is used to define the location in which the chef-client is installed, and ``"%LOCAL_DESTINATION_MSI_PATH%"`` is a variable defined in the default `windows-chef-client-msi.erb <https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/windows-chef-client-msi.erb>`_ bootstrap template. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367988%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for more information about the options available to Msiexec.exe.

.. end_tag

ADDLOCAL Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag windows_msiexec_addlocal

The ``ADDLOCAL`` parameter adds two setup options that are specific to the chef-client. These options can be passed along with an Msiexec.exe command:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``ChefClientFeature``
     - Use to install the chef-client.
   * - ``ChefSchTaskFeature``
     - Use to configure the chef-client as a scheduled task in Microsoft Windows.
   * - ``ChefPSModuleFeature``
     - Used to install the chef PowerShell module. This will enable chef command line utilities within PowerShell.

First install the chef-client, and then enable it to run as a scheduled task. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ msiexec /qn /i C:\inst\chef-client-14.5.27-1-x64.msi ADDLOCAL="ChefClientFeature,ChefSchTaskFeature,ChefPSModuleFeature"

.. end_tag

Use MSI Installer
-----------------------------------------------------
A Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) is available for installing the chef-client on a Microsoft Windows machine from `Chef Downloads <https://downloads.chef.io/>`__.

Enable as a Scheduled Task
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag install_chef_client_windows_as_scheduled_task

To run the chef-client at periodic intervals (so that it can check in with the Chef server automatically), configure the chef-client to run as a scheduled task. This can be done via the MSI, by selecting the **Chef Unattended Execution Options** --> **Chef Client Scheduled Task** option on the **Custom Setup** page or by running the following command after the chef-client is installed:

For example:

.. code-block:: none

   $ SCHTASKS.EXE /CREATE /TN ChefClientSchTask /SC MINUTE /MO 30 /F /RU "System" /RP /RL HIGHEST /TR "cmd /c \"C:\opscode\chef\embedded\bin\ruby.exe C:\opscode\chef\bin\chef-client -L C:\chef\chef-client.log -c C:\chef\client.rb\""

Refer `Schedule a Task <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc748993(v=ws.11)>`_ for more details.

After the chef-client is configured to run as a scheduled task, the default file path is: ``c:\chef\chef-client.log``.

.. end_tag

Use an Existing Process
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_install_system_center

Many organizations already have processes in place for managing the applications and settings on various Microsoft Windows machines. For example, System Center. The chef-client can be installed using this method.

.. end_tag

PATH System Variable
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag windows_environment_variable_path

On Microsoft Windows, the chef-client must have two entries added to the ``PATH`` environment variable:

* ``C:\opscode\chef\bin``
* ``C:\opscode\chef\embedded\bin``

This is typically done during the installation of the chef-client automatically. If these values (for any reason) are not in the ``PATH`` environment variable, the chef-client will not run properly.

.. image:: ../../images/includes_windows_environment_variable_path.png

This value can be set from a recipe. For example, from the ``php`` cookbook:

.. code-block:: ruby

   #  the following code sample comes from the ``package`` recipe in the ``php`` cookbook: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/php

   if platform?('windows')

     include_recipe 'iis::mod_cgi'

     install_dir = File.expand_path(node['php']['conf_dir']).gsub('/', '\\')
     windows_package node['php']['windows']['msi_name'] do
       source node['php']['windows']['msi_source']
       installer_type :msi

       options %W[
         /quiet
         INSTALLDIR="#{install_dir}"
         ADDLOCAL=#{node['php']['packages'].join(',')}
       ].join(' ')
   end

   ...

   ENV['PATH'] += ";#{install_dir}"
   windows_path install_dir

   ...

.. end_tag

Proxy Settings
=====================================================
.. tag proxy_windows

To determine the current proxy server on the Microsoft Windows platform:

#. Open **Internet Properties**.
#. Open **Connections**.
#. Open **LAN settings**.
#. View the **Proxy server** setting. If this setting is blank, then a proxy server may not be available.

To configure proxy settings in Microsoft Windows:

#. Open **System Properties**.
#. Open **Environment Variables**.
#. Open **System variables**.
#. Set ``http_proxy`` and ``https_proxy`` to the location of your proxy server. This value **MUST** be lowercase.

.. end_tag


Resources
=====================================================
.. tag resources_common

A resource is a statement of configuration policy that:

* Describes the desired state for a configuration item
* Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
* Specifies a resource type---such as ``package``, ``template``, or ``service``
* Lists additional details (also known as resource properties), as necessary
* Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations

.. end_tag

Common Functionality
-----------------------------------------------------
The following sections describe Microsoft Windows-specific functionality that applies generally to all resources:

Relative Paths
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resources_common_relative_paths

The following relative paths can be used with any resource:

``#{ENV['HOME']}``
   Use to return the ``~`` path in Linux and macOS or the ``%HOMEPATH%`` in Microsoft Windows.

.. end_tag

Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag resource_template_use_relative_paths

.. To use a relative path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template "#{ENV['HOME']}/chef-getting-started.txt" do
     source 'chef-getting-started.txt.erb'
     mode '0755'
   end

.. end_tag

Windows File Security
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resources_common_windows_security

To support Microsoft Windows security, the **template**, **file**, **remote_file**, **cookbook_file**, **directory**, and **remote_directory** resources support the use of inheritance and access control lists (ACLs) within recipes.

.. end_tag

.. note:: Windows File Security applies to the **cookbook_file**, **directory**, **file**, **remote_directory**, **remote_file**, and **template** resources.

ACLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag resources_common_windows_security_acl

The ``rights`` property can be used in a recipe to manage access control lists (ACLs), which allow permissions to be given to multiple users and groups. Use the ``rights`` property can be used as many times as necessary; the chef-client will apply them to the file or directory as required. The syntax for the ``rights`` property is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   rights permission, principal, option_type => value

where

``permission``
   Use to specify which rights are granted to the ``principal``. The possible values are: ``:read``, ``:write``, ``read_execute``, ``:modify``, and ``:full_control``.

   These permissions are cumulative. If ``:write`` is specified, then it includes ``:read``. If ``:full_control`` is specified, then it includes both ``:write`` and ``:read``.

   (For those who know the Microsoft Windows API: ``:read`` corresponds to ``GENERIC_READ``; ``:write`` corresponds to ``GENERIC_WRITE``; ``:read_execute`` corresponds to ``GENERIC_READ`` and ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``; ``:modify`` corresponds to ``GENERIC_WRITE``, ``GENERIC_READ``, ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``, and ``DELETE``; ``:full_control`` corresponds to ``GENERIC_ALL``, which allows a user to change the owner and other metadata about a file.)

``principal``
   Use to specify a group or user name. This is identical to what is entered in the login box for Microsoft Windows, such as ``user_name``, ``domain\user_name``, or ``user_name@fully_qualified_domain_name``. The chef-client does not need to know if a principal is a user or a group.

``option_type``
   A hash that contains advanced rights options. For example, the rights to a directory that only applies to the first level of children might look something like: ``rights :write, 'domain\group_name', :one_level_deep => true``. Possible option types:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 60 420
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Option Type
        - Description
      * - ``:applies_to_children``
        - Specify how permissions are applied to children. Possible values: ``true`` to inherit both child directories and files;  ``false`` to not inherit any child directories or files; ``:containers_only`` to inherit only child directories (and not files); ``:objects_only`` to recursively inherit files (and not child directories).
      * - ``:applies_to_self``
        - Indicates whether a permission is applied to the parent directory. Possible values: ``true`` to apply to the parent directory or file and its children; ``false`` to not apply only to child directories and files.
      * - ``:one_level_deep``
        - Indicates the depth to which permissions will be applied. Possible values: ``true`` to apply only to the first level of children; ``false`` to apply to all children.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   resource 'x.txt' do
     rights :read, 'Everyone'
     rights :write, 'domain\group'
     rights :full_control, 'group_name_or_user_name'
     rights :full_control, 'user_name', :applies_to_children => true
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

    rights :read, ['Administrators','Everyone']
    rights :full_control, 'Users', :applies_to_children => true
    rights :write, 'Sally', :applies_to_children => :containers_only, :applies_to_self => false, :one_level_deep => true

Some other important things to know when using the ``rights`` attribute:

* Only inherited rights remain. All existing explicit rights on the object are removed and replaced.
* If rights are not specified, nothing will be changed. The chef-client does not clear out the rights on a file or directory if rights are not specified.
* Changing inherited rights can be expensive. Microsoft Windows will propagate rights to all children recursively due to inheritance. This is a normal aspect of Microsoft Windows, so consider the frequency with which this type of action is necessary and take steps to control this type of action if performance is the primary consideration.

Use the ``deny_rights`` property to deny specific rights to specific users. The ordering is independent of using the ``rights`` property. For example, it doesn't matter if rights are granted to everyone is placed before or after ``deny_rights :read, ['Julian', 'Lewis']``, both Julian and Lewis will be unable to read the document. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   resource 'x.txt' do
     rights :read, 'Everyone'
     rights :write, 'domain\group'
     rights :full_control, 'group_name_or_user_name'
     rights :full_control, 'user_name', :applies_to_children => true
     deny_rights :read, ['Julian', 'Lewis']
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   deny_rights :full_control, ['Sally']

.. end_tag

Inheritance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag resources_common_windows_security_inherits

By default, a file or directory inherits rights from its parent directory. Most of the time this is the preferred behavior, but sometimes it may be necessary to take steps to more specifically control rights. The ``inherits`` property can be used to specifically tell the chef-client to apply (or not apply) inherited rights from its parent directory.

For example, the following example specifies the rights for a directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor' do
     rights :read, 'MORDOR\Minions'
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
   end

and then the following example specifies how to use inheritance to deny access to the child directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor\mount_doom' do
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
     inherits false # Sauron is the only person who should have any sort of access
   end

If the ``deny_rights`` permission were to be used instead, something could slip through unless all users and groups were denied.

Another example also shows how to specify rights for a directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor' do
     rights :read, 'MORDOR\Minions'
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
     rights :write, 'SHIRE\Frodo' # Who put that there I didn't put that there
   end

but then not use the ``inherits`` property to deny those rights on a child directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor\mount_doom' do
     deny_rights :read, 'MORDOR\Minions' # Oops, not specific enough
   end

Because the ``inherits`` property is not specified, the chef-client will default it to ``true``, which will ensure that security settings for existing files remain unchanged.

.. end_tag

Attributes for File-based Resources
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This resource has the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``group``
     - A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name, including fully qualified group names such as ``domain\group`` or ``group@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing groups remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default ``POSIX`` group (if available).
   * - ``inherits``
     - Microsoft Windows only. Whether a file inherits rights from its parent directory. Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``mode``
     - If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.

       Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``00755``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft Windows as they do in UNIX, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.
   * - ``owner``
     - A string or ID that identifies the group owner by user name, including fully qualified user names such as ``domain\user`` or ``user@domain``. If this value is not specified, existing owners remain unchanged and new owner assignments use the current user (when necessary).
   * - ``path``
     - The full path to the file, including the file name and its extension.

       Microsoft Windows: A path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) will point to the root of the current working directory of the chef-client process. This path can vary from system to system. Therefore, using a path that begins with a forward slash (``/``) is not recommended.
   * - ``rights``
     - Microsoft Windows only. The permissions for users and groups in a Microsoft Windows environment. For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions>`` specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options>`` is a Hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.

.. note:: Use the ``owner`` and ``right`` attributes and avoid the ``group`` and ``mode`` attributes whenever possible. The ``group`` and ``mode`` attributes are not true Microsoft Windows concepts and are provided more for backward compatibility than for best practice.

Atomic File Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resources_common_atomic_update

Atomic updates are used with **file**-based resources to help ensure that file updates can be made when updating a binary or if disk space runs out.

Atomic updates are enabled by default. They can be managed globally using the ``file_atomic_update`` setting in the client.rb file. They can be managed on a per-resource basis using the ``atomic_update`` property that is available with the **cookbook_file**, **file**, **remote_file**, and **template** resources.

.. note:: On certain platforms, and after a file has been moved into place, the chef-client may modify file permissions to support features specific to those platforms. On platforms with SELinux enabled, the chef-client will fix up the security contexts after a file has been moved into the correct location by running the ``restorecon`` command. On the Microsoft Windows platform, the chef-client will create files so that ACL inheritance works as expected.

.. end_tag

.. note:: Atomic File Updates applies to the **template** resource.

batch
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_batch_summary

Use the **batch** resource to execute a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter on Windows. The **batch** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_batch_syntax

A **batch** resource block executes a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code <<-EOH
       echo %TEMP%
       echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%
       echo %PATH%
       echo %WINDIR%
       EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **batch** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array
     creates                    String
     cwd                        String
     flags                      String
     group                      String, Integer
     guard_interpreter          Symbol
     interpreter                String
     notifies                   # see description
     returns                    Integer, Array
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    Integer, Float
     user                       String
     password                   String
     domain                     String
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :run if not specified
   end

where

* ``batch`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``command`` is the command to be run and ``cwd`` is the location from which the command is run
* ``action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``code``, ``command``, ``creates``, ``cwd``, ``flags``, ``group``, ``guard_interpreter``, ``interpreter``, ``returns``, ``timeout``, `user``, `password`` and `domain`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_batch_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:run``
   Run a batch file.

.. end_tag

Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_batch_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If a value is not provided, the chef-client defaults to the correct value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is raised when anything other than ``:i386`` is specified for a 32-bit process. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for 32-bit processes) and ``:x86_64`` (for 64-bit processes).

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

``command``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   The name of the command to be executed.

``creates``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.

``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The current working directory from which a command is run.

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One or more command line flags that are passed to the interpreter when a command is invoked.

``group``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a command.

``guard_interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol | **Default Value:** ``:batch``

   When this property is set to ``:batch``, the 64-bit version of the cmd.exe shell will be used to evaluate strings values for the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` properties. Set this value to ``:default`` to use the 32-bit version of the cmd.exe shell.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the default value of this property is not supported.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``returns``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The return value for a command. This may be an array of accepted values. An exception is raised when the return value(s) do not match.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Float | **Default Value:** ``3600``

   The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing out.

``user``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The user name of the user identity with which to launch the new process. The user name may optionally be specifed with a domain, i.e. `domain\user` or `user@my.dns.domain.com` via Universal Principal Name (UPN)format. It can also be specified without a domain simply as user if the domain is instead specified using the `domain` attribute. On Windows only, if this property is specified, the `password` property must be specified.

``password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   *Windows only*: The password of the user specified by the `user` property.
   This property is mandatory if `user` is specified on Windows and may only be specified if `user` is specified. The `sensitive` property for this resource will automatically be set to true if password is specified.

``domain``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   *Windows only*: The domain of the user user specified by the `user` property.
   If not specified, the user name and password specified by the `user` and `password` properties will be used to resolve that user against the domain in which the system running Chef client is joined, or if that system is not joined to a domain it will resolve the user as a local account on that system. An alternative way to specify the domain is to leave this property unspecified and specify the domain as part of the `user` property.

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Unzip a file, and then move it**

.. tag resource_batch_unzip_file_and_move

To run a batch file that unzips and then moves Ruby, do something like:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'unzip_and_move_ruby' do
     code <<-EOH
       7z.exe x #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32.7z
         -oC:\\source -r -y
       xcopy C:\\source\\ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32 C:\\ruby /e /y
       EOH
   end

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code <<-EOH
       echo %TEMP%
       echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%
       echo %PATH%
       echo %WINDIR%
       EOH
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'unzip_and_move_ruby' do
     code <<-EOH
       7z.exe x #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-1.8.7-p352-i386-mingw32.7z

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code 'echo %TEMP%\\necho %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\necho %PATH%\\necho %WINDIR%'
   end

.. end_tag

dsc_resource
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_generic

A `resource </resource.html>`__ defines the desired state for a single configuration item present on a node that is under management by Chef. A resource collection---one (or more) individual resources---defines the desired state for the entire node. During a `chef-client run </chef_client.html#the-chef-client-run.html>`__, the current state of each resource is tested, after which the chef-client will take any steps that are necessary to repair the node and bring it back into the desired state.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_powershell_dsc

Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a feature of Windows PowerShell that provides `a set of language extensions, cmdlets, and resources <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview>`_ that can be used to declaratively configure software. DSC is similar to Chef, in that both tools are idempotent, take similar approaches to the concept of resources, describe the configuration of a system, and then take the steps required to do that configuration. The most important difference between Chef and DSC is that Chef uses Ruby and DSC is exposed as configuration data from within Windows PowerShell.

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_dsc_resource_summary

The **dsc_resource** resource allows any DSC resource to be used in a Chef recipe, as well as any custom resources that have been added to your Windows PowerShell environment. Microsoft `frequently adds new resources <https://github.com/powershell/DscResources>`_ to the DSC resource collection.

.. end_tag

.. warning:: .. tag resource_dsc_resource_requirements

             Using the **dsc_resource** has the following requirements:

             * Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 February Preview (or higher), which includes Windows PowerShell 5.0.10018.0 (or higher).
             * The ``RefreshMode`` configuration setting in the Local Configuration Manager must be set to ``Disabled``.

               **NOTE:** Starting with the chef-client 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the chef-client from running in non-disabled refresh mode.

             * The **dsc_script** resource  may not be used in the same run-list with the **dsc_resource**. This is because the **dsc_script** resource requires that ``RefreshMode`` in the Local Configuration Manager be set to ``Push``, whereas the **dsc_resource** resource requires it to be set to ``Disabled``.

               **NOTE:** Starting with the chef-client 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the chef-client from running in non-disabled refresh mode, which allows the Local Configuration Manager to be set to ``Push``.

             * The **dsc_resource** resource can only use binary- or script-based resources. Composite DSC resources may not be used.

               This is because composite resources aren't "real" resources from the perspective of the Local Configuration Manager (LCM). Composite resources are used by the "configuration" keyword from the ``PSDesiredStateConfiguration`` module, and then evaluated in that context. When using DSC to create the configuration document (the Managed Object Framework (MOF) file) from the configuration command, the composite resource is evaluated. Any individual resources from that composite resource are written into the Managed Object Framework (MOF) document. As far as the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) is concerned, there is no such thing as a composite resource. Unless that changes, the **dsc_resource** resource and/or ``Invoke-DscResource`` command cannot directly use them.

             .. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_dsc_resource_syntax

A **dsc_resource** resource block allows DSC resources to be used in a Chef recipe. For example, the DSC ``Archive`` resource:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Archive ExampleArchive {
     Ensure = "Present"
     Path = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\example.zip"
     Destination = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\ExtractionPath"
   }

and then the same **dsc_resource** with Chef:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_resource 'example' do
      resource :archive
      property :ensure, 'Present'
      property :path, "C:\Users\Public\Documents\example.zip"
      property :destination, "C:\Users\Public\Documents\ExtractionPath"
    end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **dsc_resource** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_resource 'name' do
     module_name                String
     module_version             String
     notifies                   # see description
     property                   Symbol
     resource                   String
     subscribes                 # see description
   end

where

* ``dsc_resource`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``property`` is zero (or more) properties in the DSC resource, where each property is entered on a separate line, ``:dsc_property_name`` is the case-insensitive name of that property, and ``"property_value"`` is a Ruby value to be applied by the chef-client
* ``module_name``, ``module_version``, ``property``, and ``resource`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_dsc_resource_attributes

The dsc_resource resource has the following properties:

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``module_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the module from which a DSC resource originates. If this property is not specified, it will be inferred.

``module_version``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The version number of the module to use. PowerShell 5.0.10018.0 (or higher) supports having multiple versions of a module installed. This should be specified along with the ``module_name``.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``property``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   A property from a Desired State Configuration (DSC) resource. Use this property multiple times, one for each property in the Desired State Configuration (DSC) resource. The format for this property must follow ``property :dsc_property_name, "property_value"`` for each DSC property added to the resource block.

   The ``:dsc_property_name`` must be a symbol.

   .. tag resource_dsc_resource_ruby_types

   Use the following Ruby types to define ``property_value``:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 250 250
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Ruby
        - Windows PowerShell
      * - ``Array``
        - ``Object[]``
      * - ``Chef::Util::Powershell:PSCredential``
        - ``PSCredential``

        - ``bool($false)``
      * - ``Fixnum``
        - ``Integer``
      * - ``Float``
        - ``Double``
      * - ``Hash``
        - ``Hashtable``
      * - ``True``
        - ``bool($true)``

   These are converted into the corresponding Windows PowerShell type during the chef-client run.

   .. end_tag

``resource``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the DSC resource. This value is case-insensitive and must be a symbol that matches the name of the DSC resource.

   .. tag resource_dsc_resource_features

      * - ``:windowsprocess``
        - Use to `configure Windows processes <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/windowsprocessresource>`_.

   Any DSC resource may be used in a Chef recipe. For example, the DSC Resource Kit contains resources for `configuring Active Directory components <http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xActiveDirectory/2.8.0.0>`_, such as ``xADDomain``, ``xADDomainController``, and ``xADUser``. Assuming that these resources are available to the chef-client, the corresponding values for the ``resource`` attribute would be: ``:xADDomain``, ``:xADDomainController``, and ``xADUser``.

   .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

* ``dsc_script`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``code``, ``command``, ``configuration_data``, ``configuration_data_script``, ``configuration_name``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``flags``, ``imports``, and ``timeout`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_dsc_script_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``

   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:run``
   Default. Use to run the DSC configuration defined as defined in this resource.

.. end_tag

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_dsc_script_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The code for the DSC configuration script. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``command`` property.

``command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to a valid Windows PowerShell data file that contains the DSC configuration script. This data file must be capable of running independently of Chef and must generate a valid DSC configuration. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``code`` property.

``configuration_data``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The configuration data for the DSC script. The configuration data must be `a valid Windows PowerShell data file <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/developer/windows-powershell>`_. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``configuration_data_script`` property.

``configuration_data_script``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to a valid Windows PowerShell data file that also contains a node called ``localhost``. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``configuration_data`` property.

``configuration_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of a valid Windows PowerShell cmdlet. The name may only contain letter (a-z, A-Z), number (0-9), and underscore (_) characters and should start with a letter. The name may not be null or empty. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``code`` property.

``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The current working directory.

``environment``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A Hash of environment variables in the form of ``({"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"})``. (These variables must exist for a command to be run successfully.)

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   Pass parameters to the DSC script that is specified by the ``command`` property. Parameters are defined as key-value pairs, where the value of each key is the parameter to pass. This property may not be used in the same recipe as the ``code`` property. For example: ``flags ({ :EditorChoice => 'emacs', :EditorFlags => '--maximized' })``.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``imports``
   **Ruby Type:** Array

   .. warning:: This property **MUST** be used with the ``code`` attribute.

   Use to import DSC resources from a module.

   To import all resources from a module, specify only the module name:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      imports 'module_name'

   To import specific resources, specify the module name, and then specify the name for each resource in that module to import:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      imports 'module_name', 'resource_name_a', 'resource_name_b', ...

   For example, to import all resources from a module named ``cRDPEnabled``:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      imports 'cRDPEnabled'

   To import only the ``PSHOrg_cRDPEnabled`` resource:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      imports 'cRDPEnabled', 'PSHOrg_cRDPEnabled'

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing out.

.. end_tag

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Specify DSC code directly**

.. tag resource_dsc_script_code

DSC data can be specified directly in a recipe:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_script 'emacs' do
     code <<-EOH
     Environment 'texteditor'
     {
       Name = 'EDITOR'
       Value = 'c:\\emacs\\bin\\emacs.exe'
     }
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Specify DSC code using a Windows PowerShell data file**

.. tag resource_dsc_script_command

Use the ``command`` property to specify the path to a Windows PowerShell data file. For example, the following Windows PowerShell script defines the ``DefaultEditor``:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Configuration 'DefaultEditor'
   {
     Environment 'texteditor'
       {
         Name = 'EDITOR'
         Value = 'c:\emacs\bin\emacs.exe'
       }
   }

Use the following recipe to specify the location of that data file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_script 'DefaultEditor' do
     command 'c:\dsc_scripts\emacs.ps1'
   end

.. end_tag

**Pass parameters to DSC configurations**

.. tag resource_dsc_script_flags

If a DSC script contains configuration data that takes parameters, those parameters may be passed using the ``flags`` property. For example, the following Windows PowerShell script takes parameters for the ``EditorChoice`` and ``EditorFlags`` settings:

.. code-block:: powershell

   $choices = @{'emacs' = 'c:\emacs\bin\emacs';'vi' = 'c:\vim\vim.exe';'powershell' = 'powershell_ise.exe'}
     Configuration 'DefaultEditor'
       {
         [CmdletBinding()]
         param
           (
             $EditorChoice,
             $EditorFlags = ''
           )
         Environment 'TextEditor'
         {
           Name = 'EDITOR'
           Value =  "$($choices[$EditorChoice]) $EditorFlags"
         }
       }

Use the following recipe to set those parameters:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_script 'DefaultEditor' do
     flags ({ :EditorChoice => 'emacs', :EditorFlags => '--maximized' })
     command 'c:\dsc_scripts\editors.ps1'
   end

.. end_tag

**Use custom configuration data**

.. tag resource_dsc_script_custom_config_data

Configuration data in DSC scripts may be customized from a recipe. For example, scripts are typically customized to set the behavior for Windows PowerShell credential data types. Configuration data may be specified in one of three ways:

* By using the ``configuration_data`` attribute
* By using the ``configuration_data_script`` attribute
* By specifying the path to a valid Windows PowerShell data file

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_dsc_script_configuration_data

The following example shows how to specify custom configuration data using the ``configuration_data`` property:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_script 'BackupUser' do
     configuration_data <<-EOH
       @{
        AllNodes = @(
             @{
             NodeName = "localhost";
             PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
             })
        }
     EOH
     code <<-EOH
       $user = 'backup'
       $password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YourPass$(random)" -AsPlainText -Force
       $cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $user, $password

      User $user
        {
          UserName = $user
          Password = $cred
          Description = 'Backup operator'
          Ensure = "Present"
          Disabled = $false
          PasswordNeverExpires = $true
          PasswordChangeRequired = $false
        }
      EOH
   end

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_dsc_script_configuration_name

The following example shows how to specify custom configuration data using the ``configuration_name`` property. For example, the following Windows PowerShell script defines the ``vi`` configuration:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Configuration 'emacs'
     {
       Environment 'TextEditor'
       {
         Name = 'EDITOR'
         Value = 'c:\emacs\bin\emacs.exe'
       }
   }

   Configuration 'vi'
   {
       Environment 'TextEditor'
       {
         Name = 'EDITOR'
         Value = 'c:\vim\bin\vim.exe'
       }
   }

Use the following recipe to specify that configuration:

.. code-block:: ruby

   dsc_script 'EDITOR' do
     configuration_name 'vi'
     command 'C:\dsc_scripts\editors.ps1'
   end

.. end_tag

**Using DSC with other Chef resources**

.. tag resource_dsc_script_remote_files

The **dsc_script** resource can be used with other resources. The following example shows how to download a file using the **remote_file** resource, and then uncompress it using the DSC ``Archive`` resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   remote_file "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}\\DSCResourceKit620082014.zip" do
     source 'http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DSC-Resource-Kit-All-c449312d/file/124481/1/DSC%20Resource%20Kit%20Wave%206%2008282014.zip'
   end

   dsc_script 'get-dsc-resource-kit' do
     code <<-EOH
       Archive reskit
       {
         ensure = 'Present'
         path = "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}\\DSCResourceKit620082014.zip"
         destination = "#{ENV['PROGRAMW6432']}\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules"
       }
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

env
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_env_summary

Use the **windows_env** resource to manage environment keys in Microsoft Windows. After an environment key is set, Microsoft Windows must be restarted before the environment key will be available to the Task Scheduler.

This resource was previously called the **env** resource; its name was updated in Chef Client 14.0 to reflect the fact that only Windows is supported. Existing cookbooks using ``env`` will continue to function, but should be updated to use the new name.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_env_syntax

A **windows_env** resource block manages environment keys in Microsoft Windows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_env 'ComSpec' do
     value 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe'
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **env** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_env 'name' do
     delim                      String
     key_name                   String # defaults to 'name' if not specified
     notifies                   # see description
     subscribes                 # see description
     value                      String
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :create if not specified
   end

where

* ``windows_env`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``delim``, ``key_name``, and ``value`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_env_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:create``
   Default. Create an environment variable. If an environment variable already exists (but does not match), update that environment variable to match.

``:delete``
   Delete an environment variable.

``:modify``
   Modify an existing environment variable. This prepends the new value to the existing value, using the delimiter specified by the ``delim`` property.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

.. end_tag

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_env_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``delim``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The delimiter that is used to separate multiple values for a single key.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``key_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the key that is to be created, deleted, or modified. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``value``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The value with which ``key_name`` is set.

.. end_tag

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Set an environment variable**

.. tag resource_environment_set_variable

.. To set an environment variable:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_env 'ComSpec' do
     value "C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"
   end

.. end_tag

powershell_script
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_powershell_script_summary

Use the **powershell_script** resource to execute a script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter, much like how the **script** and **script**-based resources---**bash**, **csh**, **perl**, **python**, and **ruby**---are used. The **powershell_script** is specific to the Microsoft Windows platform and the Windows PowerShell interpreter.

The **powershell_script** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_powershell_script_syntax

A **powershell_script** resource block executes a batch script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter. For example, writing to an interpolated path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'write-to-interpolated-path' do
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **powershell_script** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array
     convert_boolean_return     true, false
     creates                    String
     cwd                        String
     environment                Hash
     flags                      String
     group                      String, Integer
     guard_interpreter          Symbol
     interpreter                String
     notifies                   # see description
     returns                    Integer, Array

     elevated                   true, false
   end

where

* ``powershell_script`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``command`` is the command to be run and ``cwd`` is the location from which the command is run
* ``action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``code``, ``command``, ``convert_boolean_return``, ``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``flags``, ``group``, ``guard_interpreter``, ``interpreter``, ``returns``, ``sensitive``, ``timeout``, ``user``, ``password``, ``domain`` and ``elevated`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_powershell_script_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``
   Inherited from **execute** resource. Prevent a command from running. This action is used to specify that a command is run only when another resource notifies it.

``:run``
   Default. Run the script.

.. end_tag

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_powershell_script_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If a value is not provided, the chef-client defaults to the correct value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is raised when anything other than ``:i386`` is specified for a 32-bit process. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for 32-bit processes) and ``:x86_64`` (for 64-bit processes).

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

``command``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   The name of the command to be executed. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``convert_boolean_return``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Return ``0`` if the last line of a command is evaluated to be true or to return ``1`` if the last line is evaluated to be false.

   When the ``guard_interpreter`` common attribute is set to ``:powershell_script``, a string command will be evaluated as if this value were set to ``true``. This is because the behavior of this attribute is similar to the value of the ``"$?"`` expression common in UNIX interpreters. For example, this:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      powershell_script 'make_safe_backup' do
        guard_interpreter :powershell_script
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test-path ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end

   is similar to:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      bash 'make_safe_backup' do
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test -e ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end

``creates``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Inherited from **execute** resource. Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.

``cwd``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The current working directory from which a command is run.

``environment``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   Inherited from **execute** resource. A Hash of environment variables in the form of ``({"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"})``. (These variables must exist for a command to be run successfully.)

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string that is passed to the Windows PowerShell command. Default value (Windows PowerShell 3.0+): ``-NoLogo, -NonInteractive, -NoProfile, -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, -InputFormat None``.

``group``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a command.

``guard_interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol | **Default Value:** ``:powershell_script``

   When this property is set to ``:powershell_script``, the 64-bit version of the Windows PowerShell shell will be used to evaluate strings values for the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` properties. Set this value to ``:default`` to use the 32-bit version of the cmd.exe shell.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the default value of this property is not supported.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``returns``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array | **Default Value:** ``0``

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The return value for a command. This may be an array of accepted values. An exception is raised when the return value(s) do not match.

``sensitive``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Ensure that sensitive resource data is not logged by the chef-client.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Float

   Inherited from **execute** resource. The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing out. Default value: ``3600``.

``user``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``nil``

   The user name of the user identity with which to launch the new process. The user name may optionally be specified with a domain, i.e. `domain\\user` or `user@my.dns.domain.com` via Universal Principal Name (UPN)format. It can also be specified without a domain simply as user if the domain is instead specified using the `domain` attribute. On Windows only, if this property is specified, the `password` property must be specified.

``password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   *Windows only*: The password of the user specified by the `user` property.
   Default value: `nil`. This property is mandatory if `user` is specified on Windows and may only be specified if `user` is specified. The `sensitive` property for this resource will automatically be set to true if password is specified.

``domain``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   *Windows only*: The domain of the user specified by the `user` property.
   Default value: `nil`. If not specified, the user name and password specified by the `user` and `password` properties will be used to resolve that user against the domain in which the system running Chef client is joined, or if that system is not joined to a domain it will resolve the user as a local account on that system. An alternative way to specify the domain is to leave this property unspecified and specify the domain as part of the `user` property.

``elevated``
    **Ruby Type:**  true, false

    Determines whether the script will run with elevated permissions to circumvent User Access Control (UAC) interactively blocking the process.

    This will cause the process to be run under a batch login instead of an interactive login. The user running Chef needs the "Replace a process level token" and "Adjust Memory Quotas for a process" permissions. The user that is running the command needs the "Log on as a batch job" permission.

    Because this requires a login, the ``user`` and ``password`` properties are required.

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Write to an interpolated path**

.. tag resource_powershell_write_to_interpolated_path

.. To write out to an interpolated path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'write-to-interpolated-path' do
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Change the working directory**

.. tag resource_powershell_cwd

.. To use the change working directory (``cwd``) attribute:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'cwd-then-write' do
     cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "C:/powershell-test2.txt"
     $pwd = pwd
     $stream.WriteLine("This is the contents of: $pwd")
     $dirs = dir
     foreach ($dir in $dirs) {
       $stream.WriteLine($dir.fullname)
     }
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Change the working directory in Microsoft Windows**

.. tag resource_powershell_cwd_microsoft_env

.. To change the working directory to a Microsoft Windows environment variable:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'cwd-to-win-env-var' do
     cwd '%TEMP%'
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./temp-write-from-chef.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("chef on windows rox yo!")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Pass an environment variable to a script**

.. tag resource_powershell_pass_env_to_script

.. To pass a Microsoft Windows environment variable to a script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'read-env-var' do
     cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
     environment ({'foo' => 'BAZ'})
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./test-read-env-var.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("FOO is $env:foo")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

registry_key
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_registry_key_summary

Use the **registry_key** resource to create and delete registry keys in Microsoft Windows.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_registry_key_syntax

A **registry_key** resource block creates and deletes registry keys in Microsoft Windows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...\\System" do
     values [{
       name: "NewRegistryKeyValue",
       type: :multi_string,
       data: ['foo\0bar\0\0']
     }]
     action :create
   end

Use multiple registry key entries with key values that are based on node attributes:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\name_of_registry_key' do
     values [{name: 'key_name', type: :string, data: 'C:\Windows\System32\file_name.bmp'},
             {name: 'key_name', type: :string, data: node['node_name']['attribute']['value']},
             {name: 'key_name', type: :string, data: node['node_name']['attribute']['value']}
            ]
     action :create
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **registry_key** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  registry_key 'name' do
    architecture      Symbol # default value: machine
    key               String # default value: 'name' unless specified
    recursive         true, false # default value: false
    values
    action            Symbol # defaults to :create if not specified
  end

where

* ``registry_key`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``values`` is a hash that contains at least one registry key to be created or deleted. Each registry key in the hash is grouped by brackets in which the ``name:``, ``type:``, and ``data:`` values for that registry key are specified.
* ``type:`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.

  .. warning:: ``:multi_string`` must be an array, even if there is only a single string.
* ``action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``key``, ``recursive`` and ``values`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

Path Separators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag windows_registry_key_backslashes

A Microsoft Windows registry key can be used as a string in Ruby code, such as when a registry key is used as the name of a recipe. In Ruby, when a registry key is enclosed in a double-quoted string (``" "``), the same backslash character (``\``) that is used to define the registry key path separator is also used in Ruby to define an escape character. Therefore, the registry key path separators must be escaped when they are enclosed in a double-quoted string. For example, the following registry key:

.. code-block:: ruby

   HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes

may be enclosed in a single-quoted string with a single backslash:

.. code-block:: ruby

   'HKCU\SOFTWARE\path\to\key\Themes'

or may be enclosed in a double-quoted string with an extra backslash as an escape character:

.. code-block:: ruby

   "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\path\\to\\key\\Themes"

.. end_tag

Recipe DSL Methods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag dsl_recipe_method_windows_methods

Six methods are present in the Recipe DSL to help verify the registry during a chef-client run on the Microsoft Windows platform---``registry_data_exists?``, ``registry_get_subkeys``, ``registry_get_values``, ``registry_has_subkeys?``, ``registry_key_exists?``, and ``registry_value_exists?``---these helpers ensure the **powershell_script** resource is idempotent.

.. end_tag

.. note:: .. tag notes_dsl_recipe_order_for_windows_methods

          The recommended order in which registry key-specific methods should be used within a recipe is: ``key_exists?``, ``value_exists?``, ``data_exists?``, ``get_values``, ``has_subkeys?``, and then ``get_subkeys``.

          .. end_tag

registry_data_exists?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag dsl_recipe_method_registry_data_exists

Use the ``registry_data_exists?`` method to find out if a Microsoft Windows registry key contains the specified data of the specified type under the value.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_not_if_only_if

          This method can be used in recipes and from within the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` blocks in resources. This method is not designed to create or modify a registry key. If a registry key needs to be modified, use the **registry_key** resource.

          .. end_tag

The syntax for the ``registry_data_exists?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_data_exists?(
     KEY_PATH,
     { name: 'NAME', type: TYPE, data: DATA },
     ARCHITECTURE
   )

where:

* ``KEY_PATH`` is the path to the registry key value. The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``{ name: 'NAME', type: TYPE, data: DATA }`` is a hash that contains the expected name, type, and data of the registry key value
* ``type:`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``. In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

This method will return ``true`` or ``false``.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_architecture

          The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.

registry_get_subkeys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tag dsl_recipe_method_registry_get_subkeys

Use the ``registry_get_subkeys`` method to get a list of registry key values that are present for a Microsoft Windows registry key.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_not_if_only_if

          This method can be used in recipes and from within the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` blocks in resources. This method is not designed to create or modify a registry key. If a registry key needs to be modified, use the **registry_key** resource.

          .. end_tag

The syntax for the ``registry_get_subkeys`` method is as follows:

For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``. In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``.

Use the ``registry_value_exists?`` method to find out if a registry key value exists. Use ``registry_data_exists?`` to test for the type and data of a registry key value.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_not_if_only_if

          This method can be used in recipes and from within the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` blocks in resources. This method is not designed to create or modify a registry key. If a registry key needs to be modified, use the **registry_key** resource.

          .. end_tag

The syntax for the ``registry_value_exists?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_value_exists?(
     KEY_PATH,
     { name: 'NAME' },
     ARCHITECTURE
   )

where:

* ``KEY_PATH`` is the path to the registry key. The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``{ name: 'NAME' }`` is a hash that contains the name of the registry key value; if either ``type:`` or ``:value`` are specified in the hash, they are ignored
* ``type:`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``. In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

This method will return ``true`` or ``false``.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_architecture

          The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.

          .. end_tag

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_registry_key_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:create``
   Default. Create a registry key. If a registry key already exists (but does not match), update that registry key to match.

``:create_if_missing``
   Create a registry key if it does not exist. Also, create a registry key value if it does not exist.

``:delete``
   Delete the specified values for a registry key.

``:delete_key``
   Delete the specified registry key and all of its subkeys.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_resource_recursive

          Be careful when using the ``:delete_key`` action with the ``recursive`` attribute. This will delete the registry key, all of its values and all of the names, types, and data associated with them. This cannot be undone by the chef-client.

          .. end_tag

.. end_tag

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_registry_key_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol | **Default Value:** ``:machine``

   The architecture of the node for which keys are to be created or deleted. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for nodes with a 32-bit registry), ``:x86_64`` (for nodes with a 64-bit registry), and ``:machine`` (to have the chef-client determine the architecture during the chef-client run).

   In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

   .. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_architecture

             The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.

             .. end_tag

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``key``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the location in which a registry key is to be created or from which a registry key is to be deleted. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See "Syntax" section above for more information.
   The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``recursive``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   When creating a key, this value specifies that the required keys for the specified path are to be created. When using the ``:delete_key`` action in a recipe, and if the registry key has subkeys, then set the value for this property to ``true``.

   .. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_resource_recursive

             Be careful when using the ``:delete_key`` action with the ``recursive`` attribute. This will delete the registry key, all of its values and all of the names, types, and data associated with them. This cannot be undone by the chef-client.

             .. end_tag

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``sensitive``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Determines whether or not sensitive resource data (such as key information) is logged by Chef Client.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``values``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash, Array

   An array of hashes, where each Hash contains the values that are to be set under a registry key. Each Hash must contain ``name:``, ``type:``, and ``data:`` (and must contain no other key values).

   ``type:`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.

   .. warning:: ``:multi_string`` must be an array, even if there is only a single string.

.. end_tag

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Create a registry key**

.. tag resource_registry_key_create

.. To disable a registry key:

Use a double-quoted string:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\path-to-key\\Policies\\System" do
     values [{
       name: 'EnableLUA',
       type: :dword,
       data: 0
     }]
     action :create
   end

or a single-quoted string:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\path-to-key\Policies\System' do
     values [{
       name: 'EnableLUA',
       type: :dword,
       data: 0
     }]
     action :create
   end

.. end_tag

**Delete a registry key value**

.. tag resource_registry_key_delete_value

.. To delete a registry key:

Use a double-quoted string:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\path\\to\\key\\AU" do
     values [{
       name: 'NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers',
       type: :dword,
       data: ''
       }]
     action :delete
   end

or a single-quoted string:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\path\to\key\AU' do
     values [{
       name: 'NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers',
       type: :dword,
       data: ''
       }]
     action :delete
   end

.. note:: If ``data:`` is not specified, you get an error: ``Missing data key in RegistryKey values hash``

.. end_tag

**Delete a registry key and its subkeys, recursively**

remote_file
-----------------------------------------------------

**Specify local Windows file path as a valid URI**

.. tag resource_remote_file_local_windows_path

When specifying a local Microsoft Windows file path as a valid file URI, an additional forward slash (``/``) is required. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   remote_file 'file:///c:/path/to/file' do
     ...       # other attributes
   end

.. end_tag

windows_package
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_package_windows

Use the **windows_package** resource to manage Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) packages for the Microsoft Windows platform.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_package_windows_syntax

A **windows_package** resource block manages a package on a node, typically by installing it. The simplest use of the **windows_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_package 'package_name'

which will install the named package using all of the default options and the default action (``:install``).

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **windows_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  windows_package 'name' do
    checksum                     String
    installer_type               Symbol
    options                      String
    package_name                 String, Array
    remote_file_attributes       Hash
    response_file                String
    response_file_variables      Hash
    returns                      String, Integer, Array # default value: [0]
    source                       String
    timeout                      String, Integer # default value: 600
    version                      String, Array
    action                       Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
  end

where:

* ``windows_package`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``checksum``, ``installer_type``, ``options``, ``package_name``, ``remote_file_attributes``, ``response_file``, ``response_file_variables``, ``returns``, ``source``, ``timeout``, and ``version`` are the properties available to this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_package_windows_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install a package. If a version is specified, install the specified version of the package.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:remove``
   Remove a package.

.. end_tag

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_package_windows_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``checksum``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The SHA-256 checksum of the file. Use to prevent a file from being re-downloaded. When the local file matches the checksum, the chef-client does not download it. Use when a URL is specified by the ``source`` property.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``installer_type``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   A symbol that specifies the type of package. Possible values: ``:custom`` (such as installing a non-.msi file that embeds an .msi-based installer), ``:inno`` (Inno Setup), ``:installshield`` (InstallShield), ``:msi`` (Microsoft Installer Package (MSI)), ``:nsis`` (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)), ``:wise`` (Wise).

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``options``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One (or more) additional options that are passed to the command.

``remote_file_attributes``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A package at a remote location define as a Hash of properties that modifes the properties of the **remote_file** resource.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``returns``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array of integers | **Default Value:** ``0``

   A comma-delimited list of return codes that indicate the success or failure of the command that was run remotely. This code signals a successful ``:install`` action.

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Optional. The path to a package in the local file system. The location of the package may be at a URL. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See the "Syntax" section above for more information.

   If the ``source`` property is not specified, the package name MUST be exactly the same as the display name found in **Add/Remove programs** or exactly the same as the ``DisplayName`` property in the appropriate registry key, which may be one of the following:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

   .. note:: If there are multiple versions of a package installed with the same display name, all of those packages will be removed unless a version is provided in the ``version`` property or unless it can be discovered in the installer file specified by the ``source`` property.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

``Chef::Provider::Package::Windows``, ``windows_package``
   The provider for the Microsoft Windows platform.

.. end_tag

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Install a package**

.. tag resource_windows_package_install

.. To install a package:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_package '7zip' do
     action :install
     source 'C:\7z920.msi'
   end

.. end_tag

**Specify a URL for the source attribute**

.. tag resource_package_windows_source_url

.. To install a package using a URL for the source:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_package '7zip' do
     source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
   end

.. end_tag

**Specify path and checksum**

.. tag resource_package_windows_source_url_checksum

.. To install a package using a URL for the source and specifying a checksum:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_package '7zip' do
     source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
     checksum '7c8e873991c82ad9cfc123415254ea6101e9a645e12977dcd518979e50fdedf3'
   end

.. end_tag

**Modify remote_file resource attributes**

.. tag resource_package_windows_source_remote_file_attributes

The **windows_package** resource may specify a package at a remote location using the ``remote_file_attributes`` property. This uses the **remote_file** resource to download the contents at the specified URL and passes in a Hash that modifes the properties of the `remote_file resource </resource_remote_file.html>`__.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_package '7zip' do
     source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
     remote_file_attributes ({
       :path => 'C:\\7zip.msi',
       :checksum => '7c8e873991c82ad9cfc123415254ea6101e9a645e12977dcd518979e50fdedf3'
     })
   end

.. end_tag

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_service_windows_syntax

A **windows_service** resource block manages the state of a service on a machine that is running Microsoft Windows. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'BITS' do
     action :configure_startup
     startup_type :manual

Attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_service_windows_attributes

The windows_service resource has the following properties:

``binary_path_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   **Required** The fully qualified path to the service binary file. The path can also include arguments for an auto-start service.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``display_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

``init_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the init script that is associated with the service. This is typically ``/etc/init.d/SERVICE_NAME``. The ``init_command`` property can be used to prevent the need to specify  overrides for the ``start_command``, ``stop_command``, and ``restart_command`` attributes.

``load_order_group``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the service's load ordering group(s). Specify ``nil`` or an empty string if the service does not belong to a group.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``pattern``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``service_name``

   The pattern to look for in the process table.

``reload_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to tell a service to reload its configuration.

``restart_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to restart a service.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``run_as_password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The password for the user specified by ``run_as_user``.

``run_as_user``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The user under which a Microsoft Windows service runs.

``service_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the service. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See the "Syntax" section above for more information.

``start_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to start a service.

``startup_type``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol | **Default Value:** ``:automatic``

   Use to specify the startup type for a Microsoft Windows service. Possible values: ``:automatic``, ``:disabled``, or ``:manual``.

``status_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to check the run status for a service.

``stop_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to stop a service.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``supports``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A list of properties that controls how the chef-client is to attempt to manage a service: ``:restart``, ``:reload``, ``:status``. For ``:restart``, the init script or other service provider can use a restart command; if ``:restart`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to stop and then start a service. For ``:reload``, the init script or other service provider can use a reload command. For ``:status``, the init script or other service provider can use a status command to determine if the service is running; if ``:status`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to match the ``service_name`` against the process table as a regular expression, unless a pattern is specified as a parameter property. Default value: ``{ restart: false, reload: false, status: false }`` for all platforms (except for the Red Hat platform family, which defaults to ``{ restart: false, reload: false, status: true }``.)

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``60``

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out.

.. end_tag

Examples

Cookbook Resources
=====================================================
Some of the most popular Chef-maintained cookbooks that contain custom resources useful when configuring machines running Microsoft Windows are listed below:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Cookbook
     - Description
   * - `iis <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/iis>`_
     - The ``iis`` cookbook is used to install and configure Internet Information Services (IIS).
   * - `webpi <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/webpi>`_
     - The ``webpi`` cookbook is used to run the Microsoft Web Platform Installer (WebPI).
   * - `windows <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows>`_
     - The ``windows`` cookbook is used to configure auto run, batch, reboot, enable built-in operating system packages, configure Microsoft Windows packages, reboot machines, and more.

Recipe DSL Methods
=====================================================
.. tag dsl_recipe_method_windows_methods

Six methods are present in the Recipe DSL to help verify the registry during a chef-client run on the Microsoft Windows platform---``registry_data_exists?``, ``registry_get_subkeys``, ``registry_get_values``, ``registry_has_subkeys?``, ``registry_key_exists?``, and ``registry_value_exists?``---these helpers ensure the **powershell_script** resource is idempotent.

.. end_tag

.. note:: .. tag notes_dsl_recipe_order_for_windows_methods

          The recommended order in which registry key-specific methods should be used within a recipe is: ``key_exists?``, ``value_exists?``, ``data_exists?``, ``get_values``, ``has_subkeys?``, and then ``get_subkeys``.

          .. end_tag

registry_data_exists?
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag dsl_recipe_method_registry_data_exists

Use the ``registry_data_exists?`` method to find out if a Microsoft Windows registry key contains the specified data of the specified type under the value.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_not_if_only_if

          This method can be used in recipes and from within the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` blocks in resources. This method is not designed to create or modify a registry key. If a registry key needs to be modified, use the **registry_key** resource.

          .. end_tag

The syntax for the ``registry_data_exists?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   registry_data_exists?(
     KEY_PATH,
     { name: 'NAME', type: TYPE, data: DATA },
     ARCHITECTURE
   )

where:

* ``KEY_PATH`` is the path to the registry key value. The path must include the registry hive, which can be specified either as its full name or as the 3- or 4-letter abbreviation. For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``{ name: 'NAME', type: TYPE, data: DATA }`` is a hash that contains the expected name, type, and data of the registry key value
* ``type:`` represents the values available for registry keys in Microsoft Windows. Use ``:binary`` for REG_BINARY, ``:string`` for REG_SZ, ``:multi_string`` for REG_MULTI_SZ, ``:expand_string`` for REG_EXPAND_SZ, ``:dword`` for REG_DWORD, ``:dword_big_endian`` for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or ``:qword`` for REG_QWORD.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``. In order to read or write 32-bit registry keys on 64-bit machines running Microsoft Windows, the ``architecture`` property must be set to ``:i386``. The ``:x86_64`` value can be used to force writing to a 64-bit registry location, but this value is less useful than the default (``:machine``) because the chef-client returns an exception if ``:x86_64`` is used and the machine turns out to be a 32-bit machine (whereas with ``:machine``, the chef-client is able to access the registry key on the 32-bit machine).

This method will return ``true`` or ``false``.

.. note:: .. tag notes_registry_key_architecture

          The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.

For example, both ``HKLM\SECURITY`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`` are both valid and equivalent. The following hives are valid: ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``, ``HKLM``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG``, ``HKCC``, ``HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT``, ``HKCR``, ``HKEY_USERS``, ``HKU``, ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``, and ``HKCU``.
* ``ARCHITECTURE`` is one of the following values: ``:x86_64``, ``:i386``, or ``:machine``.

-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag dsl_recipe_helper_windows_platform

A recipe can define specific behaviors for specific Microsoft Windows platform versions by using a series of helper methods. To enable these helper methods, add the following to a recipe:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'chef/win32/version'

Then declare a variable using the ``Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version`` class:

.. code-block:: ruby

   variable_name = Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version.new

And then use this variable to define specific behaviors for specific Microsoft Windows platform versions. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if variable_name.helper_name?
     # Ruby code goes here, such as
     resource_name do
       # resource block
     end

   elsif variable_name.helper_name?
     # Ruby code goes here
     resource_name do
       # resource block for something else
     end

   else variable_name.helper_name?
     # Ruby code goes here, such as
     log 'log entry' do
       level :level
     end

   end

The following example installs Windows PowerShell 2.0 on systems that do not already have it installed. Microsoft Windows platform helper methods are used to define specific behaviors for specific platform versions:

.. code-block:: ruby

   case node['platform']
   when 'windows'

     require 'chef/win32/version'
     windows_version = Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version.new

     if (windows_version.windows_server_2008_r2? || windows_version.windows_7?) && windows_version.core?

       windows_feature 'NetFx2-ServerCore' do
         action :install
       end
       windows_feature 'NetFx2-ServerCore-WOW64' do
         action :install
         only_if { node['kernel']['machine'] == 'x86_64' }
       end

     elsif windows_version.windows_server_2008? || windows_version.windows_server_2003_r2? ||
         windows_version.windows_server_2003? || windows_version.windows_xp?

       if windows_version.windows_server_2008?
         windows_feature 'NET-Framework-Core' do
           action :install
         end

       else
         windows_package 'Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2' do
           source node['ms_dotnet2']['url']
           checksum node['ms_dotnet2']['checksum']
           installer_type :custom
           options '/quiet /norestart'
           action :install
         end
       end
     else
       log '.NET Framework 2.0 is already enabled on this version of Windows' do
         level :warn
       end
     end
   else
     log '.NET Framework 2.0 cannot be installed on platforms other than Windows' do
       level :warn
     end
   end

The previous example is from the `ms_dotnet2 cookbook <https://github.com/juliandunn/ms_dotnet2>`_, created by community member ``juliandunn``.

chef-client
=====================================================
.. tag chef_client_summary

A chef-client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is under management by Chef. When a chef-client is run, it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node into the expected state, including:

* Registering and authenticating the node with the Chef server
* Building the node object
* Synchronizing cookbooks
* Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
* Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
* Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required

.. end_tag

This command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-client OPTION VALUE OPTION VALUE ...

This command has the following options specific to Microsoft Windows:

``-A``, ``--fatal-windows-admin-check``
   Cause a chef-client run to fail when the chef-client does not have administrator privileges in Microsoft Windows.

``-d``, ``--daemonize``
   Run the executable as a daemon.

   This option is only available on machines that run in UNIX or Linux environments. For machines that are running Microsoft Windows that require similar functionality, use the ``chef-client::service`` recipe in the ``chef-client`` cookbook: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-client. This will install a chef-client service under Microsoft Windows using the Windows Service Wrapper.

.. note:: chef-solo also uses the ``--daemonize`` setting for Microsoft Windows.

Run w/Elevated Privileges
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_client_elevated_privileges

The chef-client may need to be run with elevated privileges in order to get a recipe to converge correctly. On UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems this can be done by running the command as root. On Microsoft Windows this can be done by running the command prompt as an administrator.

.. end_tag

.. tag ctl_chef_client_elevated_privileges_windows

On Microsoft Windows, running without elevated privileges (when they are necessary) is an issue that fails silently. It will appear that the chef-client completed its run successfully, but the changes will not have been made. When this occurs, do one of the following to run the chef-client as the administrator:

* Log in to the administrator account. (This is not the same as an account in the administrator's security group.)

* Run the chef-client process from the administrator account while being logged into another account. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ runas /user:Administrator "cmd /C chef-client"

   This will prompt for the administrator account password.

* Open a command prompt by right-clicking on the command prompt application, and then selecting **Run as administrator**. After the command window opens, the chef-client can be run as the administrator

.. end_tag

config.rb
=====================================================
When running Microsoft Windows, the config.rb file is located at ``%HOMEDRIVE%:%HOMEPATH%\.chef`` (e.g. ``c:\Users\<username>\.chef``). If this path needs to be scripted, use ``%USERPROFILE%\.chef``.
