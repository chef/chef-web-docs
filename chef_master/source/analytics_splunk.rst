Use the Chef App for Splunk to gather insights about nodes that are under management by Chef. The Chef App for Splunk requires Chef Analytics version 1.1.4 (or later).

.. note:: Splunk Enterprise is required to use the Chef App for Splunk. Splunk light does not support the installation of packaged Splunk applications.

To set up the Chef App for Splunk, do the following:

#. Download and install Chef Analytics.
#. Configure a notification for the Splunk server.
#. Go to the **Notifications** tab in the Chef Analytics web user interface.
#. Click the plus symbol (**+**) and select Splunk.
#. Name the configuration. For example: ``splunk-notifier``.
#. Configure the hostname, port, username, and password for the Splunk server.
#. The default port is ``8089``; modify to match your Splunk install.
#. You can choose what data to send to the Splunk server by type. Valid types are ``action``, ``run_converge``, ``run_resource``, ``run_control``, and ``run_control_group``. Add the following rules to enable data to be sent to the Splunk server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      rules 'Splunk'
        rule on action
        when
          true
        then
          notify('splunk-notifier')
        end

        rule on run_converge
        when
          true
        then
          notify('splunk-notifier')
        end

        rule on run_resource
        when
          true
        then
          notify('splunk-notifier')
        end
      end

The ``rules`` block **MUST** be exactly as shown. If these rules do not match exactly, the Chef App for Splunk may not work correctly.
