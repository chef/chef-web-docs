.. warning:: .. tag notes_provisioning

             This functionality was available with Chef provisioning and was packaged in the Chef development kit.

             Chef Provisioning is no longer included with Chef DK, and will be officially end of life on August 31, 2019.  The source code of Chef Provisioning and the drivers have been moved into the chef-boneyard organization. Current users of Chef Provisioning should contact your Chef Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to review your options.

Chef Infra Client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is under management by Chef Infra Server. When a Chef Infra Client is run, it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node into the expected state, including:

* Registering and authenticating the node with the Chef Infra Server
* Building the node object
* Synchronizing cookbooks
* Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
* Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
* Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required

.. end_tag

Use the **chef_client** resource to manage clients.

Syntax
=====================================================
The syntax for using the **chef_client** resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_client 'name' do
     attribute 'value' # see properties section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where

* ``chef_client`` tells the chef-client to use the ``Chef::Provider::ChefClient`` provider during the chef-client run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``name`` property is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the name of the chef-client
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available for this resource
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state

Actions
=====================================================
This resource has the following actions:

``:create``
   Default. Use to create a chef-client.

``:delete``
   Use to delete a chef-client.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   This resource block does not act unless notified by another resource to take action. Once notified, this resource block either runs immediately or is queued up to run at the end of the Chef Infra Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:regenerate_keys``
   Use to regenerate the RSA public key for a chef-client.

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``admin``
   Use to specify whether the chef-client is an API client.

``chef_server``
   The URL for the Chef server.

``complete``
   Use to specify if this resource defines a chef-client completely. When ``true``, any property not specified by this resource will be reset to default property values.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``name``
   The name of the chef-client.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``output_key_format``
   Use to specify the format of a public key. Possible values: ``pem``, ``der``, or ``openssh``. Default value: ``openssh``.

``output_key_path``
   Use to specify the path to the location in which a public key will be written.

``raw_json``
   The chef-client as JSON data. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "clientname": "client_name",
        "orgname": "org_name",
        "validator": false,
        "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n
                        ...
                        1234567890abcdefghijklmnopq\n
                        ...
                        -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
        "name": "node_name"
      }

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of attempts to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``source_key``
   Use to copy a public or private key, but apply a different ``format`` and ``password``. Use in conjunction with ``source_key_pass_phrase``` and ``source_key_path``.

``source_key_pass_phrase``
   The pass phrase for the public key. Use in conjunction with ``source_key``` and ``source_key_path``.

``source_key_path``
   The path to the public key. Use in conjunction with ``source_key``` and ``source_key_pass_phrase``.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

    file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
      mode '0600'
      owner 'root'
    end

    service 'nginx' do
      subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
    end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``validator``
   Use to specify if the chef-client is a chef-validator.
