.. warning:: .. tag notes_provisioning

             This functionality was available with Chef provisioning and was packaged in the Chef development kit.

             Chef Provisioning is no longer included with Chef DK, and will be officially end of life on August 31, 2019.  The source code of Chef Provisioning and the drivers have been moved into the chef-boneyard organization. Current users of Chef Provisioning should contact your Chef Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to review your options.

             .. end_tag

Use the **chef_mirror** resource to mirror objects in the chef-repo to a specified location.

Syntax
=====================================================
The syntax for using the **chef_mirror** resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_mirror 'name' do
     attribute 'value' # see properties section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where

* ``chef_mirror`` tells the chef-client to use the ``Chef::Provider::ChefMirror`` provider during the chef-client run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``path`` property is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the name of the chef-client
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available for this resource
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state

Actions
=====================================================
This resource has the following actions:

``:download``

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   This resource block does not act unless notified by another resource to take action. Once notified, this resource block either runs immediately or is queued up to run at the end of the Chef Infra Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:upload``

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``chef_repo_path``
   The path to the chef-repo.

``chef_server``
   The URL for the Chef server.

``concurrency``
   The number of threads to run in-parallel. Default value: ``10``.

``freeze_on_upload``
   Use to freeze cookbooks upon upload to the mirrored location. When ``true`` (default), cookbooks are frozen.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``no_diff``
   Use to upload only new files.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``path``
   A path to a directory in the chef-repo to be mirrored. For example: ``nodes``, ``nodes/*``, ``/nodes/my_node``, ``*/*``, ``roles/base``, ``data/secrets``, ``cookbooks/apache2``, and so on.

``purge``
   Use to remove objects that have been deleted locally from the mirrored location. For example, when used with the ``:upload`` action, cookbooks that exist in the mirrored location, but do not exist locally, will be deleted.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The number of attempts to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

   The retry delay (in seconds).

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

    file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
      mode '0600'
      owner 'root'
    end

    service 'nginx' do
      subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
    end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``versioned_cookbooks``
   Append cookbook versions to cookbooks. Set to ``false`` to hide cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache``. Set to ``true`` to show cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.0`` and/or ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.1``. When this setting is ``true``, ``knife download`` downloads ALL cookbook versions, which can be useful if a full-fidelity backup of data on the Chef server is required. Defaults to ``true`` when ``chef_repo_path`` is specified, but this property is not.
