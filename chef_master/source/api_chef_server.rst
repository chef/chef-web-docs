Chef Server API
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/api_chef_server.rst>`__

.. tag api_chef_server_summary

The Chef server API is a REST API that provides access to objects on the Chef server, including nodes, environments, roles, cookbooks (and cookbook versions), and to manage an API client list and the associated RSA public key-pairs.

.. end_tag

Requirements
=====================================================
.. tag api_chef_server_requirements

The Chef server API has the following requirements:

* Access to a Chef server running version 0.10.x or above.
* The ``Accept`` header must be set to ``application/json``.
* For ``PUT`` and ``POST`` requests, the ``Content-Type`` header must be set to ``application/json``.
* The ``X-Chef-Version`` header must be set to the version of the Chef server API that is being used.
* A request must be signed using ``Mixlib::Authentication``.
* A request must be well-formatted. The easiest way to ensure a well-formatted request is to use the ``Chef::REST`` library.

Changed in Chef Client 12.7, now code that uses ``Chef::Rest`` must use ``require ``chef\rest``

.. end_tag

Authentication Headers
=====================================================
.. tag api_chef_server_headers

Authentication to the Chef server occurs when a specific set of HTTP headers are signed using a private key that is associated with the machine from which the request is made. The request is authorized if the Chef server can verify the signature using the public key. Only authorized actions are allowed.

.. note:: Most authentication requests made to the Chef server are abstracted from the user. Such as when using knife or the Chef server user interface. In some cases, such as when using the ``knife exec`` subcommand, the authentication requests need to be made more explicitly, but still in a way that does not require authentication headers. In a few cases, such as when using arbitrary Ruby code or cURL, it may be necessary to include the full authentication header as part of the request to the Chef server.

.. end_tag

Header Format
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag api_chef_server_headers_format

All hashing is done using SHA-1 and encoded in Base64. Base64 encoding should have line breaks every 60 characters. Each canonical header should be encoded in the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   Method:HTTP_METHOD
   Hashed Path:HASHED_PATH
   X-Ops-Content-Hash:HASHED_BODY
   X-Ops-Timestamp:TIME
   X-Ops-UserId:USERID

where:

* ``HTTP_METHOD`` is the method used in the API request (``GET``, ``POST``, and so on)
* ``HASHED_PATH`` is the path of the request: ``/organizations/NAME/name_of_endpoint``. The ``HASHED_PATH`` must be hashed using SHA-1 and encoded using Base64, must not have repeated forward slashes (``/``), must not end in a forward slash (unless the path is ``/``), and must not include a query string.
* The private key must be an RSA key in the SSL .pem file format. This signature is then broken into character strings (of not more than 60 characters per line) and placed in the header.

The Chef server decrypts this header and ensures its content matches the content of the non-encrypted headers that were in the request. The timestamp of the message is checked to ensure the request was received within a reasonable amount of time. One approach generating the signed headers is to use `mixlib-authentication <https://github.com/chef/mixlib-authentication>`_, which is a class-based header signing authentication object similar to the one used by the chef-client.

.. end_tag

Required Headers
-----------------------------------------------------
The following authentication headers are required:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 130 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - ``Accept``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_accept

       The format in which response data from the Chef server is provided. This header must be set to ``application/json``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``Content-Type``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_content_type

       The format in which data is sent to the Chef server. This header is required for ``PUT`` and ``POST`` requests and must be set to ``application/json``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``Host``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_host

       The host name (and port number) to which a request is sent. (Port number ``80`` does not need to be specified.) For example: ``api.opscode.com`` (which is the same as ``api.opscode.com:80``) or ``api.opscode.com:443``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Chef-Version``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_chef_version

       The version of the chef-client executable from which a request is made. This header ensures that responses are in the correct format. For example: ``12.0.2`` or ``11.16.x``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Authorization-N``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_authorization

       One (or more) 60 character segments that comprise the canonical header. A canonical header is signed with the private key used by the client machine from which the request is sent, and is also encoded using Base64. If more than one segment is required, each should be named sequentially, e.g. ``X-Ops-Authorization-1``, ``X-Ops-Authorization-2``, ``X-Ops-Authorization-N``, where ``N`` represents the integer used by the last header that is part of the request.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Content-Hash``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_content_hash

       The body of the request. The body should be hashed using SHA-1 and encoded using Base64. All hashing is done using SHA-1 and encoded in Base64. Base64 encoding should have line breaks every 60 characters.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Server-API-Version``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_server_api_version

       Use ``X-Ops-Server-API-Version`` to specify the version of the Chef server API. For example: ``X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 1``. ``X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 0`` is supported for use with the version 12 Chef server, but will be deprecated as part of the next major release.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Sign``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_sign

       Set this header to the following value: ``version=1.0``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-Timestamp``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_timestamp

       The timestamp, in ISO-8601 format and with UTC indicated by a trailing ``Z`` and separated by the character ``T``. For example: ``2013-03-10T14:14:44Z``.

       .. end_tag

   * - ``X-Ops-UserId``
     - .. tag api_chef_server_headers_x_ops_userid

       The name of the API client whose private key will be used to create the authorization header.

       .. end_tag

.. note:: Use ``X-Ops-Server-API-Info`` to identify the version of the Chef server API.

.. end_tag

Knife API Requests
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_summary

A knife plugin is a set of one (or more) subcommands that can be added to knife to support additional functionality that is not built-in to the base set of knife subcommands. Many of the knife plugins are built by members of the Chef community and several of them are built and maintained by Chef. A knife plugin is installed to the ``~/.chef/plugins/knife/`` directory, from where it can be run just like any other knife subcommand.

.. end_tag

.. tag plugin_knife_using_authenticated_requests

A knife plugin can be used to make authenticated API requests to the Chef server using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``rest.delete_rest``
     - Use to delete an object from the Chef server.
   * - ``rest.get_rest``
     - Use to get the details of an object on the Chef server.
   * - ``rest.post_rest``
     - Use to add an object to the Chef server.
   * - ``rest.put_rest``
     - Use to update an object on the Chef server.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   module MyCommands
     class MyNodeDelete < Chef::Knife
       #An implementation of knife node delete
       banner 'knife my node delete [NODE_NAME]'

     def run
       if name_args.length < 1
         show_usage
         ui.fatal("You must specify a node name.")
         exit 1
       end
       nodename = name_args[0]
          api_endpoint = "nodes/#{nodename}"
          # Again, we could just call rest.delete_rest
          nodey = rest.get_rest(api_endpoint)
          ui.confirm("Do you really want to delete #{nodey}")
          nodey.destroy
        end
      end
   end

.. end_tag

Global Endpoints
=====================================================
.. tag api_chef_server_endpoints_global

A global endpoint may be used to access all of the organizations on the Chef server.

.. end_tag

/license
-----------------------------------------------------
.. note:: This endpoint is used for information purposes only and to trigger a notification in the Chef management console about the number of licenses owned vs. the number of licenses that should be owned. No other action is taken and the functionality and behavior of the Chef server and any added component does not change.

The ``/license`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to get license information for the Chef server.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none

   GET /organizations/NAME/license

**Response**

The response is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "limit_exceeded": "false",
     "node_license": "25",
     "node_count": "12",
     "upgrade_url": "http://www.chef.io/contact/on-premises-simple"
   }

When ``node_count`` is greater than ``node_license``, then ``limit_exceeded`` is ``true`` and the Chef management console will display a notification about this status. The way to resolve this is to visit the upgrade URL, add the appropriate number of licenses, and then update the configuration settings appropriately.

The chef-server.rb file contains settings that can be used to edit the number of nodes that are under license:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300

       "name": "default",
       "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----",
       "private_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
   }

Store the private key in a safe place. It will be required later (along with the client name) to access the Chef server when using the Chef server API.

/cookbooks
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag cookbooks_summary

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything that is required to support that scenario:

* Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied
* Attribute values
* File distributions
* Templates
* Extensions to Chef, such as custom resources and libraries

.. end_tag

When a cookbook is uploaded, only files that are new or updated will be included. This approach minimizes the amount of storage and time that is required during the modify-upload-test cycle. To keep track of which files have already been uploaded, the chef-client uses a checksum and assigns a checksum to each file. These checksums are used in the cookbook version manifest, alongside the same records that store the file description (name, specificity, and so on), as well as the checksum and the URL from which the file's contents can be retrieved.

The ``/cookbooks`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to return a hash of all cookbooks and cookbook versions.

This method has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``num_versions=n``
     - The number of cookbook versions to include in the response, where ``n`` is the number of cookbook versions. For example: ``num_versions=3`` returns the three latest versions, in descending order (newest to oldest). Use ``num_versions=all`` to return all cookbook versions. If ``num_versions`` is not specified, a single cookbook version is returned. ``0`` is an invalid input (an empty array for the versions of each cookbook is returned).

/cookbooks/NAME/version
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag cookbooks_version

A cookbook version represents a set of functionality that is different from the cookbook on which it is based. A version may exist for many reasons, such as ensuring the correct use of a third-party component, updating a bug fix, or adding an improvement. A cookbook version is defined using syntax and operators, may be associated with environments, cookbook metadata, and/or run-lists, and may be frozen (to prevent unwanted updates from being made).

A cookbook version is maintained just like a cookbook, with regard to source control, uploading it to the Chef server, and how the chef-client applies that cookbook when configuring nodes.

/roles
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag role

A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run-list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a chef-client runs, it merges its own attributes and run-lists with those contained within each assigned role.

A search is a full-text query that can be done from several locations, including from within a recipe, by using the ``search`` subcommand in knife, the ``search`` method in the Recipe DSL, the search box in the Chef management console, and by using the ``/search`` or ``/search/INDEX`` endpoints in the Chef server API. The search engine is based on Apache Solr and is run from the Chef server.

.. end_tag

The ``/search`` endpoint allows nodes, roles, data bags, environments to be searched. This endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

.. note:: At the end of every chef-client run, the node object is saved to the Chef server. From the Chef server, each node object is then added to the Apache Solr search index. This process is asynchronous. By default, node objects are committed to the search index every 60 seconds or per 1000 node objects, whichever occurs first.

.. note:: This endpoint does not have any ACL restrictions, which means it may be used by any user or client that is able to make the request to the Chef server.

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to return a data structure that contains links to each available search index. By default, the ``role``, ``node``, ``client``, and ``data bag`` indexes will always be available (where the ``data bag`` index is the name of the data bag on the Chef server). Search indexes may lag behind the most current data at any given time. If a situation occurs where data needs to be written and then immediately searched, an artificial delay (of at least 10 seconds) is recommended.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none

   GET /organizations/NAME/search

This method has no request body.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "node": "https://localhost/search/node",
     "role": "https://localhost/search/role",
     "client": "https://localhost/search/client",
     "users": "https://localhost/search/users"
   }

**Response Codes**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Response Code
     - Description
   * - ``200``
     - OK. The request was successful.
   * - ``401``
     - Unauthorized. The user or client who made the request could not be authenticated. Verify the user/client name, and that the correct key was used to sign the request.
   * - ``403``
     - Forbidden. The user who made the request is not authorized to perform the action.

/search/INDEX
-----------------------------------------------------
Use the ``/search/INDEX`` endpoint to access the search indexes on the Chef server. The ``/search/INDEX`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET`` and ``POST``.

.. tag search_query_syntax

A search query is comprised of two parts: the key and the search pattern. A search query has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   key:search_pattern

where ``key`` is a field name that is found in the JSON description of an indexable object on the Chef server (a role, node, client, environment, or data bag) and ``search_pattern`` defines what will be searched for, using one of the following search patterns: exact, wildcard, range, or fuzzy matching. Both ``key`` and ``search_pattern`` are case-sensitive; ``key`` has limited support for multiple character wildcard matching using an asterisk ("*") (and as long as it is not the first character).

.. end_tag

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``GET`` method is used to return all of the data that matches the query in the ``GET`` request.

This method has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``q``
     - The search query used to identify a list of items on a Chef server. This option uses the same syntax as the ``search`` subcommand.
   * - ``rows``
     - The number of rows to be returned.
   * - ``sort``
     - The order in which search results are to be sorted.
   * - ``start``
     - The row at which return results begin.

**Request**

.. code-block:: none

   GET /organizations/NAME/search/INDEX

**Response**

The response contains the total number of rows that match the request and is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "total": 1,
    "start": 0,
    "rows": [
       {
        "overrides": {"hardware_type": "laptop"},
        "name": "latte",
        "chef_type": "node",
        "json_class": "Chef::Node",
        "attributes": {"hardware_type": "laptop"},
        "run_list": ["recipe[unicorn]"],
        "defaults": {}
       }
     ]
   }

**Response Codes**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Response Code
     - Description
   * - ``200``
     - OK. The request was successful.
   * - ``401``
     - Unauthorized. The user or client who made the request could not be authenticated. Verify the user/client name, and that the correct key was used to sign the request.
   * - ``403``
     - Forbidden. The user who made the request is not authorized to perform the action.
   * - ``404``
     - Not found. The requested object does not exist.

POST
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A partial search query allows a search query to be made against specific attribute keys that are stored on the Chef server. A partial search query can search the same set of objects on the Chef server as a full search query, including specifying an object index and providing a query that can be matched to the relevant index. While a full search query will return an array of objects that match (each object containing a full set of attributes for the node), a partial search query will return only the values for the attributes that match. One primary benefit of using a partial search query is that it requires less memory and network bandwidth while the chef-client processes the search results.

To create a partial search query, use the ``search`` method, and then specify the key paths for the attributes to be returned. Each key path should be specified as an array of strings and is mapped to an arbitrary short name. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   search(:node, 'role:web',
     :filter_result => { 'name' => [ 'name' ],
                'ip'   => [ 'ipaddress' ],
                'kernel_version' => [ 'kernel', 'version' ]
              }
   ) do |result|
     puts result['name']
     puts result['ip']
     puts result['kernel_version']
   end

In the previous example, two attributes will be extracted (on the Chef server) from any node that matches the search query. The result will be a simple hash with keys ``name``, ``ip``, and ``kernel_version``.

The ``POST`` method is used to return partial search results. For example, if a node has the following:

.. code-block:: none

   {
     'x' => 'foo',
     'kernel' => { 'a' => 1, 'foo' => 'bar', 'version' => [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
   }

a partial search query can be used to return something like:

.. code-block:: none

   { 'kernel_version' => [ 1, 2, 3 ] }

This method has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``q``
     - The search query used to identify a list of items on a Chef server. This option uses the same syntax as the ``search`` subcommand.
   * - ``rows``
     - The number of rows to be returned.
   * - ``sort``
     - The order in which search results are to be sorted.
   * - ``start``
     - The row at which return results begin.

Examples
=====================================================
The following sections show examples of using the Chef server API.

Query for Users and Orgs
-----------------------------------------------------
The following example shows how to query the Chef server API for a listing of organizations and users. The ``/organizations`` and ``/users`` endpoints may only be accessed by the ``pivotal`` user, which is a user account that is created by Chef during the installation of the Chef server.

Run the following from a ``.chef`` directory that contains a ``pivotal.rb`` file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'chef'
   require 'chef/rest'

   Chef::Config.from_file(".chef/pivotal.rb")
   rest = Chef::REST.new(Chef::Config[:chef_server_url])
   orgs = rest.get_rest("/organizations")

   puts "\n=== Listing of organizations"
   orgs.each do |org|
     puts org
   end

   puts "\n=== Listing of Users"
   users = rest.get_rest("/users")
   users.each do |user|
     puts user
   end

An examle of a ``.chef/pivotal.rb`` file is shown below:

.. code-block:: ruby

   current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
   node_name "pivotal"
   chef_server_url "https://192.168.1.2:443"
   chef_server_root "https://192.168.1.2:443"
   client_key "#{current_dir}/pivotal.pem"

.. note:: The ``pivotal.pem`` file must exist in the specified location and the IP addresses must be correct for the Chef server.
