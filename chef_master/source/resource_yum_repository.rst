yum_repository resource
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_yum_repository.rst>`__

Use the **yum_repository** resource to manage a Yum repository configuration file located at ``/etc/yum.repos.d/repositoryid.repo`` on the local machine. This configuration file specifies which repositories to reference, how to handle cached data, etc.

**New in Chef Client 12.14.**

Syntax
=====================================================
The yum_repository resource has the following syntax:

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

.. Refer to http://linux.die.net/man/5/yum.conf as the source for these descriptions.

``baseurl``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   URL to the directory where the Yum repository's 'repodata' directory lives. Can be an http://, https:// or a ftp:// URL. You can specify multiple URLs in one baseurl statement.

``clean_headers``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false`` | ``DEPRECATED``

   Specifies whether you want to purge the package data files that are downloaded from a Yum repository and held in a cache directory.

``clean_metadata``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``true``

   Specifies whether you want to purge all of the packages downloaded from a Yum repository and held in a cache directory.

``cost``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Relative cost of accessing this repository. Useful for weighing one repo's packages as greater/less than any other.

``description``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``Yum Repository``

   Descriptive name for the repository channel and maps to the 'name' parameter in a repository .conf.

``enabled``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``true``

   Specifies whether or not Yum should use this repository.

``enablegroups``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Specifies whether Yum will allow the use of package groups for this repository.

``exclude``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   List of packages to exclude from updates or installs. This should be a space separated list. Shell globs using wildcards (eg. * and ?) are allowed.

``failovermethod``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Method to determine how to switch to a new server if the current one fails, which can either be ``roundrobin`` or ``priority``. ``roundrobin`` randomly selects a URL out of the list of URLs to start with and proceeds through each of them as it encounters a failure contacting the host. ``priority`` starts from the first ``baseurl`` listed and reads through them sequentially.

``fastestmirror_enabled``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Specifies whether to use the fastest mirror from a repository configuration when more than one mirror is listed in that configuration.

``gpgcheck``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``true``

   Specifies whether or not Yum should perform a GPG signature check on the packages received from a repository.

``gpgkey``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   URL pointing to the ASCII-armored GPG key file for the repository. This is used if Yum needs a public key to verify a package and the required key hasn't been imported into the RPM database. If this option is set, Yum will automatically import the key from the specified URL.

   Multiple URLs may be specified in the same manner as the baseurl option. If a GPG key is required to install a package from a repository, all keys specified for that repository will be installed.

``http_caching``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Determines how upstream HTTP caches are instructed to handle any HTTP downloads that Yum does. This option can take the following values:

   * ``all`` means that all HTTP downloads should be cached.

   * ``packages`` means that only RPM package downloads should be cached, but not repository metadata downloads.

   * ``none`` means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.

   The default is ``all``. This is recommended unless you are experiencing caching related issues.

``include_config``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   An external configuration file using the format ``url://to/some/location``.

``includepkgs``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Inverse of exclude property. This is a list of packages you want to use from a repository. If this option lists only one package then that is all Yum will ever see from the repository.

``keepalive``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Determines whether or not HTTP/1.1 ``keep-alive`` should be used with this repository.

``make_cache``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``true``

   Determines whether package files downloaded by Yum stay in cache directories. By using cached data, you can carry out certain operations without a network connection.

``max_retries``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   Number of times any attempt to retrieve a file should retry before returning an error. Setting this to '0' makes Yum try forever.

``metadata_expire``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Time (in seconds) after which the metadata will expire. If the current metadata downloaded is less than the value specified, then Yum will not update the metadata against the repository. If you find that Yum is not downloading information on updates as often as you would like lower the value of this option. You can also change from the default of using seconds to using days, hours or minutes by appending a 'd', 'h' or 'm' respectively. The default is six hours to compliment yum-updates running once per hour. It is also possible to use the word ``never``, meaning that the metadata will never expire. Note: When using a metalink file, the metalink must always be newer than the metadata for the repository due to the validation, so this timeout also applies to the metalink file.

   .. note:: When using a metalink file, the metalink must always be newer than the metadata for the repository due to the validation, so this timeout also applies to the metalink file.

``metalink``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Specifies a URL to a metalink file for the repomd.xml, a list of mirrors for the entire repository are generated by converting the mirrors for the repomd.xml file to a baseurl.

``mirror_expire``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Time (in seconds) after which the mirrorlist locally cached will expire. If the current mirrorlist is less than this many seconds old then Yum will not download another copy of the mirrorlist, it has the same extra format as metadata_expire. If you find that Yum is not downloading the mirrorlists as often as you would like lower the value of this option.

``mirrorlist``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   URL to a file containing a list of baseurls. This can be used instead of or with the baseurl option. Substitution variables, described below, can be used with this option.

``mirrorlist_expire``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Specifies the time (in seconds) after which the mirrorlist locally cached will expire. If the current mirrorlist is less than the value specified, then Yum will not download another copy of the mirrorlist.

``mode``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer | **Default Value:** ``0644``

   Permissions mode of .repo file on disk. This is useful for scenarios where secrets are in the repo file. If this value is set to '600', normal users will not be able to use Yum search, Yum info, etc.

``options``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   Specifies the repository options.

``password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Password to use with the username for basic authentication.

``priority``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Assigns a priority to a repository where the priority value is between '1' and '99' inclusive. Priorities are used to enforce ordered protection of repositories. Packages from repositories with a lower priority (higher numerical value) will never be used to upgrade packages that were installed from a repository with a higher priority (lower numerical value). The repositories with the lowest numerical priority number have the highest priority.

``proxy``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   URL to the proxy server that Yum should use.

``proxy_password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Password for this proxy.

``proxy_username``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Username to use for proxy.

``repo_gpgcheck``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Determines whether or not Yum should perform a GPG signature check on the repodata from this repository.

``report_instanceid``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Determines whether to report the instance ID when using Amazon Linux AMIs and repositories.

``repositoryid``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``'name'``

   Specifies a unique name for each repository, one word. Defaults to name attribute.

``skip_if_unavailable``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Allow yum to continue if this repository cannot be contacted for any reason.

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Use a custom template source instead of the default one.

``sslcacert``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Path to the directory containing the databases of the certificate authorities Yum should use to verify SSL certificates.

``sslclientcert``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Path to the SSL client certificate Yum should use to connect to repos/remote sites.

``sslclientkey``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Path to the SSL client key Yum should use to connect to repos/remote sites.

``sslverify``
   **Ruby Type:** true, false

   Determines whether Yum will verify SSL certificates/hosts.

``throttle``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   Enable bandwidth throttling for downloads.

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Number of seconds to wait for a connection before timing out. Defaults to 30 seconds. This may be too short of a time for extremely overloaded sites.

``username``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Username to use for basic authentication to a repository.

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

   yum_repository 'OurCo' do
     description 'OurCo yum repository'
     mirrorlist 'http://artifacts.ourco.org/mirrorlist?repo=ourco-6&arch=$basearch'
     gpgkey 'http://artifacts.ourco.org/pub/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-OURCO-6'
     action :create
   end

**Delete a repository**

.. code-block:: ruby

   yum_repository 'CentOS-Media' do
     action :delete
   end
