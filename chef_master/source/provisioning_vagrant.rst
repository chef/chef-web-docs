.. warning:: ..

  The Vagrant driver for Chef Provisioning has been deprecated and is no longer supported or recommended for use.

Chef provisioning is a collection of resources that enable the creation of machines and machine infrastructures using the Chef Infra Client. It has a plugin model that allows bootstrap operations to be done against any infrastructure, such as VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, Amazon EC2, LXC, bare metal, and more.

Chef provisioning is built around two major components: the **machine** resource and drivers.

Chef provisioning is packaged in ChefDK. Chef provisioning is a framework that allows clusters to be managed by the Chef Infra Client and the Chef Infra Server in the same way nodes are managed: with recipes. Use Chef provisioning to describe, version, deploy, and manage clusters of any size and complexity using a common set of tools.

A driver-specific resource is a statement of configuration policy that:

* Describes the desired state for a configuration item that is created using Chef provisioning
* Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
* Specifies a resource type---such as ``package``, ``template``, or ``service``
* Lists additional details (also known as properties), as necessary
* Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations

.. end_tag

The following driver-specific resources are available for Vagrant and Chef provisioning:

* ``vagrant_box``
* ``vagrant_cluster``

vagrant_box
=====================================================
The ``vagrant_box`` resource is a driver-specific resource used by Chef provisioning. Use the ``vagrant_box`` resource to add and remove machines that are running in Vagrant and using VirtualBox by default.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
A ``vagrant_box`` resource block typically declares a box to be created using Vagrant. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   vagrant_box 'opscode-centos-6.4' do
     url 'http://bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/vmware/centos-6.4.box'
     vagrant_provider 'vmware_desktop'
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the ``vagrant_box`` resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   vagrant_box 'name' do
     driver_options          Hash
     vagrant_provider        String
     url                     String
   end

where

* ``vagrant_box`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block and also the name of an instance in Amazon EC2
* ``driver_options``, ``vagrant_provider``, and ``url`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

Properties
-----------------------------------------------------
This Chef provisioning driver-specific resource has the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``driver_options``
     - **Ruby Type:** Hash

       Use to specify driver options.
   * - ``name``
     - **Ruby Type:** String

       The name of the Vagrant box.
   * - ``vagrant_provider``
     - **Ruby Type:** String

       The name of the provider for Vagrant. Default value: ``virtualbox``.
   * - ``url``
     - **Ruby Type:** String

       The URL from which the Vagrant box is downloaded.

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------
None.

vagrant_cluster
=====================================================
The ``vagrant_cluster`` resource is a driver-specific resource used by Chef provisioning. Use the ``vagrant_cluster`` resource to build a group of boxes in Vagrant using a single Vagrantfile that defines each of the boxes in the group. The ``vagrant list`` command will show all of the boxes that are configured with the Vagrantfile.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
A ``vagrant_cluster`` resource block typically declares a cluster to be created or deleted. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

.. code-block:: ruby

   vagrant_cluster '/path/to/cluster' do
     action :delete
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the ``vagrant_cluster`` resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   vagrant_cluster 'name' do
     path                    String
   end

where

* ``vagrant_cluster`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block and also the name of a cluster
* ``path`` is a property of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

Properties
-----------------------------------------------------
This Chef provisioning driver-specific resource has the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``path``
     - **Ruby Type:** String

       The path to the Vagrant cluster.

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------
None.
