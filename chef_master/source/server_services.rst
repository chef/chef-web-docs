Services
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/server_services.rst>`__

The Chef server has a built in process supervisor, which ensures that all of the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service.

Service Subcommands
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_common_service_subcommands

This command has a built in process supervisor that ensures all of the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service and provides the following subcommands for managing services: ``hup``, ``int``, ``kill``, ``once``, ``restart``, ``service-list``, ``start``, ``status``, ``stop``, ``tail``, and ``term``.

.. end_tag

hup
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_hup

The ``hup`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGHUP`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl hup SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

int
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_int

The ``int`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGINT`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl int SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

kill
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_kill

The ``kill`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGKILL`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl kill SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

once
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_once

The supervisor for the Chef server is configured to restart any service that fails, unless that service has been asked to change its state. The ``once`` subcommand is used to tell the supervisor to not attempt to restart any service that fails.

This command is useful when troubleshooting configuration errors that prevent a service from starting. Run the ``once`` subcommand followed by the ``status`` subcommand to look for services in a down state and/or to identify which services are in trouble. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl once SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

restart
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_restart

The ``restart`` subcommand is used to restart all services enabled on the Chef server or to restart an individual service by specifying the name of that service in the command.

.. warning:: When running the Chef server in a high availability configuration, restarting all services may trigger failover.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl restart SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully restarted the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

.. end_tag

service-list
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_service_list

The ``service-list`` subcommand is used to display a list of all available services. A service that is enabled is labeled with an asterisk (*).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl service-list

.. end_tag

start
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_start

The ``start`` subcommand is used to start all services that are enabled in the Chef server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl start SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully started the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

The supervisor for the Chef server is configured to wait seven seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If you see output that references a timeout, it means that a signal has been sent to the process, but that the process has yet to actually comply. In general, processes that have timed out are not a big concern, unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all. If a process is not responding, use a command like the ``kill`` subcommand to stop the process, investigate the cause (if required), and then use the ``start`` subcommand to re-enable it.

.. end_tag

status
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_status

The ``status`` subcommand is used to show the status of all services available to the Chef server. The results will vary based on the configuration of a given server. This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl status

and will return the status for all services. Status can be returned for individual services by specifying the name of the service as part of the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl status SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

When service status is requested, the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ run: service_name: (pid 12345) 12345s; run: log: (pid 1234) 67890s

where

* ``run:`` is the state of the service (``run:`` or ``down:``)
* ``service_name:`` is the name of the service for which status is returned
* ``(pid 12345)`` is the process identifier
* ``12345s`` is the uptime of the service, in seconds

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ down: opscode-erchef: (pid 35546) 10s

By default, runit will restart services automatically when the services fail. Therefore, runit may report the status of a service as ``run:`` even when there is an issue with that service. When investigating why a particular service is not running as it should be, look for the services with the shortest uptimes. For example, the list below indicates that the **opscode-erchef** should be investigated further:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: oc-id
   run: opscode-chef: (pid 4327) 13671s; run: log: (pid 4326) 13671s
   run: opscode-erchef: (pid 5383) 5s; run: log: (pid 4382) 13669s
   run: opscode-expander: (pid 4078) 13694s; run: log: (pid 4077) 13694s
   run: opscode-expander-reindexer: (pid 4130) 13692s; run: log: (pid 4114) 13692s

.. end_tag

High Availability
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_status_ha

On back-end servers in a high availability topology, Keepalived is used by the clustering service to determine whether a service should be running. If the ``status`` subcommand is run against any of these nodes, a few things change:

* On the back-end node that is currently the backup server, it is normal to see only one running process: Keepalived
* On the back-end node that is currently the master server, it is normal to see all services running. It is also normal to see some services in a down state if the server, on reboot, did not attempt to start the services because Keepalived determines which services are restarted based on the state of the cluster

A sample status line for a service that is running on the master server in a high availability topology:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: opscode-solr4: (pid 25341) 239s, normally down; run: log: (pid 5700) 145308s

.. end_tag

Log Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_status_logs

A typical status line for a service that is running any of the Chef server front-end services is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s

where:

* ``run`` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep processes. This state is either ``run`` or ``down``. If a service is in a ``down`` state, it should be stopped
* ``name_of_service`` is the service name, for example: ``opscode-solr4``
* ``(pid 1486) 7819s;`` is the process identifier followed by the amount of time (in seconds) the service has been running
* ``run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s`` is the log process. It is typical for a log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   down: opscode-solr4: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s

where

* ``down`` indicates that the service is in a down state
* ``3s, normally up;`` indicates that the service is normally in a run state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service after a reboot

.. end_tag

stop
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_stop

The ``stop`` subcommand is used to stop all services enabled on the Chef server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl stop SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully stopped the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: diwb: service_name: 0s, normally up

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl stop

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   ok: down: nginx: 393s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-chef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-erchef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander: 390s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander-reindexer: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-solr4: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: postgresql: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: rabbitmq: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: redis_lb: 387s, normally up

.. end_tag

tail
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_tail

The ``tail`` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef server logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl tail SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

term
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_term

The ``term`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGTERM`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl term SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.
