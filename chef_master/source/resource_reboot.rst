`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_reboot.rst>`__

.. tag resource_service_reboot

Use the **reboot** resource to reboot a node, a necessary step with some installations on certain platforms. This resource is supported for use on the Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
The reboot resource has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

  reboot 'name' do
    delay_mins      Integer # default value: 0
    reason          String # default value: "Reboot by Chef"
    action          Symbol # defaults to :nothing if not specified
  end

where:

* ``reboot`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``delay_mins`` and ``reason`` are the properties available to this resource.

Actions
=====================================================
The reboot resource has the following actions:

``:cancel``
   Cancel a reboot request.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   This resource block does not act unless notified by another resource to take action. Once notified, this resource block either runs immediately or is queued up to run at the end of the Chef Infra Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:reboot_now``
   Reboot a node so that the chef-client may continue the installation process.

``:request_reboot``
   Reboot a node at the end of a chef-client run.


Properties
=====================================================

The reboot resource has the following properties:

``delay_mins``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

   The amount of time (in minutes) to delay a reboot request.

``reason``
   **Ruby Type:** String | **Default Value:** ``"Reboot by Chef"``

   A string that describes the reboot action.


Common Resource Functionality
=====================================================

Chef resources include common properties, notifications, and resource guards.

Common Properties
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_properties

The following properties are common to every resource:

``ignore_failure``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``retries``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

  The number of attempts to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

  The retry delay (in seconds).

``sensitive``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Ensure that sensitive resource data is not logged by the chef-client.

.. end_tag

Notifications
-----------------------------------------------------

``notifies``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

  .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

  A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

  .. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

``subscribes``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

.. code-block:: ruby

 file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
   mode '0600'
   owner 'root'
 end

 service 'nginx' do
   subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
 end

In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of the chef-client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell the chef-client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for the chef-client to do nothing.

.. end_tag
.. tag resources_common_guards_properties

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of the chef-client run:

``not_if``
  Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
  Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes:

**Reboot a node immediately**

.. tag resource_service_reboot_immediately

.. To reboot immediately:

.. code-block:: ruby

   reboot 'now' do
     action :nothing
     reason 'Cannot continue Chef run without a reboot.'
     delay_mins 2
   end

   execute 'foo' do
     command '...'
     notifies :reboot_now, 'reboot[now]', :immediately
   end

.. end_tag

**Reboot a node at the end of a chef-client run**

.. tag resource_service_reboot_request

.. To reboot a node at the end of the chef-client run:

.. code-block:: ruby

   reboot 'app_requires_reboot' do
     action :request_reboot
     reason 'Need to reboot when the run completes successfully.'
     delay_mins 5
   end

.. end_tag

**Cancel a reboot**

.. tag resource_service_reboot_cancel

.. To cancel a reboot request:

.. code-block:: ruby

   reboot 'cancel_reboot_request' do
     action :cancel
     reason 'Cancel a previous end-of-run reboot request.'
   end

.. end_tag

**Rename computer, join domain, reboot**

.. tag resource_powershell_rename_join_reboot

The following example shows how to rename a computer, join a domain, and then reboot the computer:

.. code-block:: ruby

   reboot 'Restart Computer' do
     action :nothing
   end

   powershell_script 'Rename and Join Domain' do
     code <<-EOH
       ...your rename and domain join logic here...
     EOH
     not_if <<-EOH
       $ComputerSystem = gwmi win32_computersystem
       ($ComputerSystem.Name -like '#{node['some_attribute_that_has_the_new_name']}') -and
         $ComputerSystem.partofdomain)
     EOH
     notifies :reboot_now, 'reboot[Restart Computer]', :immediately
   end

where:

* The **powershell_script** resource block renames a computer, and then joins a domain
* The **reboot** resource restarts the computer
* The ``not_if`` guard prevents the Windows PowerShell script from running when the settings in the ``not_if`` guard match the desired state
* The ``notifies`` statement tells the **reboot** resource block to run if the **powershell_script** block was executed during the chef-client run

.. end_tag
