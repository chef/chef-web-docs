.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

.. end_tag

Chef Automate 1.5.46 or later provides you the ability to store and manage compliance profiles, view compliance reports over time, and quickly filter compliance reports through a dashboard interface. In addition to seeing your compliance status, you can also easily see which controls failed and why to provide you immediate information for remediation. 

.. note:: If you need to continue using the previous compliance view that was in earlier versions of Chef Automate, you can enable this view easily. We have included a new feature flag to activate the old compliance view by typing ``legacy`` in the UI and toggling on this view in the menu.

.. tag beta_note

This feature is in ``beta`` release. To access this feature, place your cursor anywhere on an Automate page, type ``beta`` and enable the feature.

Different reporting perspectives
=====================================================

When analyzing compliance reports, Chef Automate provides the ability to pivot the data based on either nodes or profiles. The same detailed information is available in both views; however, depending on your role, you have the ability to drill down on the information that is important to you.

Powerful filtering of report data
=====================================================

Chef Automate provides the ability to filter on the compliance status of the nodes in your cluster. You can filter your data on categories such as the profile used, platform of the node, environment, and so on. You can also chain these filters together to get precise results over your report data.

See `Filter Compliance Scans in Chef Automate </filter_compliance_scan.html>`_ for more information.

Profile Store
=====================================================

Chef Automate contains a collection of built-in profiles to help you perform security audits of the nodes in your Chef Automate cluster. These profiles exist for many scenarios, such as those created by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), to help you audit your nodes for security requirements based on governmental and business needs. 

These profiles can be searched and managed through the Chef Automate web UI. If you require custom profiles to be used across your cluster, Chef Automate also provides the ability to upload those profiles.

The following is a list of built-in profiles. See `Perform a Compliance Scan in Chef Automate </perform_compliance_scan.html>`_ to see how to use these profiles against nodes in your cluster.
