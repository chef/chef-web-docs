The following sections describe how to uninstall Chef, add-ons, and other components.

Chef Server
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_chef_server_uninstall

The ``uninstall`` subcommand is used to remove the Chef Infra Server application, but without removing any of the data. This subcommand will shut down all services (including the ``runit`` process supervisor).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl uninstall

.. note:: To revert the ``uninstall`` subcommand, run the ``reconfigure`` subcommand (because the ``start`` subcommand is disabled by the ``uninstall`` command).

.. end_tag

Chef Manage
=====================================================
To uninstall the Chef management console, do the following:

#. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-manage-ctl cleanse

.. note:: This package used to be named ``opscode-manage`` and the command line tool used to be named ``opscode-manage-ctl``.
