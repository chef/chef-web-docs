windows_service resource
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_windows_service.rst>`__

Use the **windows_service** resource to create, delete, or manage a service on the Microsoft Windows platform.

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag resource_service_windows_syntax

A **windows_service** resource block manages the state of a service on a machine that is running Microsoft Windows. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'BITS' do
     action :configure_startup
     startup_type :manual
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **windows_service** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'name' do
     binary_path_name           String
     desired_access             Integer
     delayed_start              [Integer] # This only applies if startup_type is :automatic
     dependencies               [String, Array]
     description                String
     desired_access             Integer # defaults to 983551
     display_name               String
     error_control              Integer
     init_command               String
     load_order_group           String
     notifies                   # see description
     pattern                    String
     reload_command             String # not used on the Windows platform
     restart_command            String
     run_as_password            String
     run_as_user                String
     service_name               String # defaults to 'name' if not specified
     service_type               Integer # defaults to 'SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS'
     start_command              String
     startup_type               Symbol
     status_command             String
     stop_command               String
     subscribes                 # see description
     supports                   Hash
     timeout                    Integer
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :nothing if not specified
   end

Properties
=====================================================
.. tag resource_service_windows_attributes

This resource has the following properties:

``binary_path_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   **Required** The fully qualified path to the service binary file. The path can also include arguments for an auto-start service.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``display_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The display name to be used by user interface programs to identify the service. This string has a maximum length of 256 characters.

``delayed_start``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   Set the startup type to delayed start. This only applies if ``startup_type`` is ``:automatic``.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``dependencies``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   A pointer to a double null-terminated array of null-separated names of services or load ordering groups that the system must start before this service. Specify ``nil`` or an empty string if the service has no dependencies. Dependency on a group means that this service can run if at least one member of the group is running after an attempt to start all members of the group.

``init_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the init script that is associated with the service. This is typically ``/etc/init.d/SERVICE_NAME``. The ``init_command`` property can be used to prevent the need to specify  overrides for the ``start_command``, ``stop_command``, and ``restart_command`` attributes. Default value: ``nil``.

``load_order_group``
   **Ruby Types:** String

   The name of the service's load ordering group(s). Specify ``nil`` or an empty string if the service does not belong to a group.

   New in Chef Client 14.0.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``pattern``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The pattern to look for in the process table. Default value: ``service_name``.

``reload_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to tell a service to reload its configuration.

``restart_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to restart a service.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``run_as_password``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The password for the user specified by ``run_as_user``.

``run_as_user``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The user under which a Microsoft Windows service runs.

``service_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the service. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block. See the "Syntax" section above for more information.

``start_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to start a service.

``startup_type``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   Use to specify the startup type for a Microsoft Windows service. Possible values: ``:automatic``, ``:disabled``, or ``:manual``. Default value: ``:automatic``.

``status_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to check the run status for a service.

``stop_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to stop a service.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``supports``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A list of properties that controls how the chef-client is to attempt to manage a service: ``:restart``, ``:reload``, ``:status``. For ``:restart``, the init script or other service provider can use a restart command; if ``:restart`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to stop and then start a service. For ``:reload``, the init script or other service provider can use a reload command. For ``:status``, the init script or other service provider can use a status command to determine if the service is running; if ``:status`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to match the ``service_name`` against the process table as a regular expression, unless a pattern is specified as a parameter property. Default value: ``{ restart: false, reload: false, status: false }`` for all platforms (except for the Red Hat platform family, which defaults to ``{ restart: false, reload: false, status: true }``.)

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out. Default value: ``60``.

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Start a service manually**

.. tag resource_service_windows_manual_start

.. To install a package:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'BITS' do
     action :configure_startup
     startup_type :manual
   end

.. end_tag

**Create a service**

.. tag resource_service_windows_create

.. To create service with 'name':

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :create
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
   end

Create service with 'service_name' and 'display_name':

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'Create chef client as service' do
     action :create
     display_name "CHEF-CLIENT"
     service_name "chef-client"
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
   end

Create service with the ``:manual`` startup type:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :create
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
     startup_type :manual
   end

Create a service with the ``:disabled`` startup type:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :create
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
     startup_type :disabled
   end

Create service with the ``:automatic`` startup type and delayed start enabled:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :create
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
     startup_type :automatic
     delayed_start true
   end

Create service with a description:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :create
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
     startup_type :automatic
     description "Chef client as service"
   end

.. end_tag

**Delete a service**

.. tag resource_service_windows_delete

Delete service with the ``'name'`` of ``chef-client``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :delete
   end

Delete service with ``'service_name'``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'Delete chef client' do
     action :delete
     service_name "chef-client"
   end

.. end_tag

**Configure a service**

.. tag resource_service_windows_configure

Change an existing service from automatic to manual startup:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'chef-client' do
     action :configure
     binary_path_name "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"
     startup_type :manual
   end

.. end_tag
