About Files
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/files.rst>`__

Files are managed using the following resources:

* Use the `cookbook_file </resource_cookbook_file.html>`__ resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the ``/files`` directory in a cookbook.
* Use the `file </resource_file.html>`__ resource to manage files directly on a node.
* Use the `remote_file </resource_remote_file.html>`__ resource to transfer files to nodes from remote locations.
* Use the `template </resource_template.html>`__ resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the ``/templates`` directory in a cookbook.
