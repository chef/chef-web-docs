.. tag server_rbac

The Chef Infra Server uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to objects---nodes, environments, roles, data bags, cookbooks, and so on. This ensures that only authorized user and/or Chef Infra Client requests to the Chef Infra Server are allowed. Access to objects on the Chef Infra Server is fine-grained, allowing access to be defined by object type, object, group, user, and organization. The Chef Infra Server uses permissions to define how a user may interact with an object, after they have been authorized to do so.

.. end_tag

.. tag server_rbac_components

The Chef Infra Server uses organizations, groups, and users to define role-based access control:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_server_organization.svg
          :width: 100px
          :align: center

     - An organization is the top-level entity for role-based access control in the Chef Infra Server. Each organization contains the default groups (``admins``, ``clients``, and ``users``, plus ``billing_admins`` for the hosted Chef Infra Server), at least one user and at least one node (on which the Chef Infra Client is installed). The Chef Infra Server supports multiple organizations. The Chef Infra Server includes a single default organization that is defined during setup. Additional organizations can be created after the initial setup and configuration of the Chef Infra Server.
   * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_server_groups.svg
          :width: 100px
          :align: center

     - .. tag server_rbac_groups

       A group is used to define access to object types and objects in the Chef Infra Server and also to assign permissions that determine what types of tasks are available to members of that group who are authorized to perform them. Groups are configured per-organization.

       Individual users who are members of a group will inherit the permissions assigned to the group. The Chef Infra Server includes the following default groups: ``admins``, ``clients``, and ``users``. For users of the hosted Chef Infra Server, an additional default group is provided: ``billing_admins``.

       .. end_tag

   * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_server_users.svg
          :width: 100px
          :align: center

     - A user is any non-administrator human being who will manage data that is uploaded to the Chef Infra Server from a workstation or who will log on to the Chef management console web user interface. The Chef Infra Server includes a single default user that is defined during setup and is automatically assigned to the ``admins`` group.

          :width: 100px
          :align: center

     - .. tag server_rbac_clients

       A client is an actor that has permission to access the Chef Infra Server. A client is most often a node (on which the Chef Infra Client runs), but is also a workstation (on which knife runs), or some other machine that is configured to use the Chef Infra Server API. Each request to the Chef Infra Server that is made by a client uses a private key for authentication that must be authorized by the public key on the Chef Infra Server.

       .. end_tag

.. end_tag

.. tag server_rbac_workflow

When a user makes a request to the Chef Infra Server using the Chef Infra Server API, permission to perform that action is determined by the following process:

#. Check if the user has permission to the object type
#. If no, recursively check if the user is a member of a security group that has permission to that object
#. If yes, allow the user to perform the action

Permissions are managed using the Chef management console add-on in the Chef Infra Server web user interface.

.. end_tag

Multiple Organizations
=====================================================
.. tag server_rbac_orgs_multi

A single instance of the Chef Infra Server can support many organizations. Each organization has a unique set of groups and users. Each organization manages a unique set of nodes, on which a Chef Infra Client is installed and configured so that it may interact with a single organization on the Chef Infra Server.

.. image:: ../../images/server_rbac_orgs_groups_and_users.png

A user may belong to multiple organizations under the following conditions:

* Role-based access control is configured per-organization
* For a single user to interact with the Chef Infra Server using knife from the same chef-repo, that user may need to edit their config.rb file prior to that interaction

.. end_tag

.. tag server_rbac_orgs_multi_use

Using multiple organizations within the Chef Infra Server ensures that the same toolset, coding patterns and practices, physical hardware, and product support effort is being applied across the entire company, even when:

* Multiple product groups must be supported---each product group can have its own security requirements, schedule, and goals
* Updates occur on different schedules---the nodes in one organization are managed completely independently from the nodes in another
* Individual teams have competing needs for object and object types---data bags, environments, roles, and cookbooks are unique to each organization, even if they share the same name

.. end_tag

Permissions
=====================================================
.. tag server_rbac_permissions

Permissions are used in the Chef Infra Server to define how users and groups can interact with objects on the server. Permissions are configured per-organization.

.. end_tag

Object Permissions
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_rbac_permissions_object

The Chef Infra Server includes the following object permissions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Permission
     - Description
   * - **Delete**
     - Use the **Delete** permission to define which users and groups may delete an object. This permission is required for any user who uses the ``knife [object] delete [object_name]`` argument to interact with objects on the Chef Infra Server.
   * - **Grant**
     - Use the **Grant** permission to define which users and groups may configure permissions on an object. This permission is required for any user who configures permissions using the **Administration** tab in the Chef management console.
   * - **Read**
     - Use the **Read** permission to define which users and groups may view the details of an object. This permission is required for any user who uses the ``knife [object] show [object_name]`` argument to interact with objects on the Chef Infra Server.
   * - **Update**
     - Use the **Update** permission to define which users and groups may edit the details of an object. This permission is required for any user who uses the ``knife [object] edit [object_name]`` argument to interact with objects on the Chef Infra Server and for any Chef Infra Client to save node data to the Chef Infra Server at the conclusion of a Chef Infra Client run.

.. end_tag

Global Permissions
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_rbac_permissions_global

The Chef Infra Server includes the following global permissions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Permission
     - Description
   * - **Create**
     - Use the **Create** global permission to define which users and groups may create the following server object types: cookbooks, data bags, environments, nodes, roles, and tags. This permission is required for any user who uses the ``knife [object] create`` argument to interact with objects on the Chef Infra Server.
   * - **List**
     - Use the **List** global permission to define which users and groups may view the following server object types: cookbooks, data bags, environments, nodes, roles, and tags. This permission is required for any user who uses the ``knife [object] list`` argument to interact with objects on the Chef Infra Server.

These permissions set the default permissions for the following Chef Infra Server object types: clients, cookbooks, data bags, environments, groups, nodes, roles, and sandboxes.

.. end_tag

Client Key Permissions
-----------------------------------------------------
.. note:: This is only necessary after migrating a client from one Chef Infra Server to another. Permissions must be reset for client keys after the migration.

.. tag server_rbac_clients

A client is an actor that has permission to access the Chef Infra Server. A client is most often a node (on which the Chef Infra Client runs), but is also a workstation (on which knife runs), or some other machine that is configured to use the Chef Infra Server API. Each request to the Chef Infra Server that is made by a client uses a private key for authentication that must be authorized by the public key on the Chef Infra Server.

.. end_tag

.. tag server_rbac_permissions_key

Keys should have ``DELETE``, ``GRANT``, ``READ`` and ``UPDATE`` permissions.

Use the following code to set the correct permissions:

.. code-block:: ruby

   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
   require 'chef/knife'

   #previously knife.rb
   Chef::Config.from_file(File.join(Chef::Knife.chef_config_dir, 'knife.rb'))

   rest = Chef::ServerAPI.new(Chef::Config[:chef_server_url])

   Chef::Node.list.each do |node|
     %w{read update delete grant}.each do |perm|
       ace = rest.get("nodes/#{node[0]}/_acl")[perm]
       ace['actors'] << node[0] unless ace['actors'].include?(node[0])
       rest.put("nodes/#{node[0]}/_acl/#{perm}", perm => ace)
       puts "Client \"#{node[0]}\" granted \"#{perm}\" access on node \"#{node[0]}\""
     end
   end

Save it as a Ruby script---``chef_server_permissions.rb``, for example---in the ``.chef/scripts`` directory located in the chef-repo, and then run a knife command similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife exec chef_server_permissions.rb

.. end_tag

Default Permissions
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_rbac_groups

A group is used to define access to object types and objects in the Chef Infra Server and also to assign permissions that determine what types of tasks are available to members of that group who are authorized to perform them. Groups are configured per-organization.

Individual users who are members of a group will inherit the permissions assigned to the group. The Chef Infra Server includes the following default groups: ``admins``, ``clients``, and ``users``. For users of the hosted Chef Infra Server, an additional default group is provided: ``billing_admins``.

.. end_tag

Knife ACL
-----------------------------------------------------

The knife plugin `knife-acl <https://github.com/chef/knife-acl>`_ provides a fine-grained approach to modifying permissions, by wrapping API calls to the ``_acl`` endpoint and makes such permission changes easier to manage.

`knife-acl` and the Chef Manage browser interface are incompatible. After engaging `knife-acl`, you will need to discontinue using the Chef Manage browser interface from that point forward due to possible incompatibilities.

Groups
=====================================================
.. tag server_rbac_groups

A group is used to define access to object types and objects in the Chef Infra Server and also to assign permissions that determine what types of tasks are available to members of that group who are authorized to perform them. Groups are configured per-organization.

Individual users who are members of a group will inherit the permissions assigned to the group. The Chef Infra Server includes the following default groups: ``admins``, ``clients``, and ``users``. For users of the hosted Chef Infra Server, an additional default group is provided: ``billing_admins``.

.. end_tag

Default Groups
-----------------------------------------------------
The following sections show the default permissions assigned by the Chef Infra Server to the ``admins``, ``billing_admins``, ``clients``, and ``users`` groups.

.. note:: The creator of an object on the Chef Infra Server is assigned ``create``, ``delete``, ``grant``, ``read``, and ``update`` permission to that object.

admins

The ``public_key_read_access`` group controls which users and clients have `read permissions to the following endpoints </api_chef_server.html>`__:

* GET /clients/CLIENT/keys
* GET /clients/CLIENT/keys/KEY
* GET /users/USER/keys
* GET /users/USER/keys/

By default, the ``public_key_read_access`` assigns all members of the ``users`` and ``clients`` group permission to these endpoints:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 160 100 100 100 100 100

chef-validator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag security_chef_validator

Every request made by the Chef Infra Client to the Chef Infra Server must be an authenticated request using the Chef Infra Server API and a private key. When the Chef Infra Client makes a request to the Chef Infra Server, the Chef Infra Client authenticates each request using a private key located in ``/etc/chef/client.pem``.

.. end_tag

The chef-validator is allowed to do the following at the start of a Chef Infra Client run. After the Chef Infra Client is registered with Chef Infra Server, that Chef Infra Client is added to the ``clients`` group:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 160 100 100 100 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Object
     - Create
     - Delete
     - Read

   * - clients
     - yes
     - no
     - no
     - no

Chef Push Jobs Groups
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag push_jobs_summary

Chef Push Jobs is an extension of the Chef Infra Server that allows jobs to be run against nodes independently of a Chef Infra Client run. A job is an action or a command to be executed against a subset of nodes; the nodes against which a job is run are determined by the results of a search query made to the Chef Infra Server.

Chef Push Jobs uses the Chef Infra Server API and a Ruby client to initiate all connections to the Chef Infra Server. Connections use the same authentication and authorization model as any other request made to the Chef Infra Server. A knife plugin is used to initiate job creation and job tracking.

.. end_tag

.. tag server_rbac_groups_push_jobs

It is possible to initiate jobs from the Chef Infra Client, such as from within a recipe based on an action to be determined as the recipe runs. For a Chef Infra Client to be able to create, initiate, or read jobs, the Chef Infra Client on which Chef Push Jobs is configured must belong to one (or both) of the following groups:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Group
     - Description
   * - ``pushy_job_readers``
     - Use to view the status of jobs.
   * - ``pushy_job_writers``
     - Use to create and initiate jobs.

These groups do not exist by default, even after Chef Push Jobs has been installed to the Chef Infra Server. If these groups are not created, only members of the ``admin`` security group will be able to create, initiate, and view jobs.

.. end_tag

Server Admins
=====================================================
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins

The ``server-admins`` group is a global group that grants its members permission to create, read, update, and delete user accounts, with the exception of superuser accounts. The ``server-admins`` group is useful for users who are responsible for day-to-day administration of the Chef Infra Server, especially user management via the ``knife user`` subcommand. Before members can be added to the ``server-admins`` group, they must already have a user account on the Chef Infra Server.

.. end_tag

Scenario
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins_scenario

The following user accounts exist on the Chef Infra Server: ``pivotal`` (a superuser account), ``alice``, ``bob``, ``carol``, and ``dan``. Run the following command to view a list of users on the Chef Infra Server:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl user-list

and it returns the same list of users:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

Alice is a member of the IT team whose responsibilities include day-to-day administration of the Chef Infra Server, in particular managing the user accounts on the Chef Infra Server that are used by the rest of the organization. From a workstation, Alice runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and it returns the following error:

.. code-block:: bash

   ERROR: You authenticated successfully to <chef_server_url> as alice
          but you are not authorized for this action
   Response: Missing read permission

Alice is not a superuser and does not have permissions on other users because user accounts are global to organizations in the Chef Infra Server. Let's add Alice to the ``server-admins`` group:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions alice

and it returns the following response:

.. code-block:: bash

   User alice was added to server-admins.

Alice can now create, read, update, and delete user accounts on the Chef Infra Server, even for organizations to which Alice is not a member. From a workstation, Alice re-runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

which now returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

Alice is now a server administrator and can use the following knife subcommands to manage users on the Chef Infra Server:

* ``knife user-create``
* ``knife user-delete``
* ``knife user-edit``
* ``knife user-list``
* ``knife user-show``

For example, Alice runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user edit carol -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and the $EDITOR opens in which Alice makes changes, and then saves them.

.. end_tag

Superuser Accounts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins_superusers

Superuser accounts may not be managed by users who belong to the ``server-admins`` group. For example, Alice attempts to delete the ``pivotal`` superuser account:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user delete pivotal -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and the following error is returned:

.. code-block:: bash

   ERROR: You authenticated successfully to <chef_server_url> as user1
          but you are not authorized for this action
   Response: Missing read permission

Alice's action is unauthorized even with membership in the ``server-admins`` group.

.. end_tag

Manage server-admins Group
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin

Membership of the ``server-admins`` group is managed with a set of ``chef-server-ctl`` subcommands:

* ``chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions``
* ``chef-server-ctl list-server-admins``
* ``chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions``

.. end_tag

Add Members
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_grant_user

The ``grant-server-admin-permissions`` subcommand is used to add a user to the ``server-admins`` group. Run the command once per user added.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions USER_NAME

where ``USER_NAME`` is the user to add to the list of server administrators.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions bob

returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   User bob was added to server-admins. This user can now list,
   read, and create users (even for orgs they are not members of)
   for this Chef Infra Server.

.. end_tag

Remove Members
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_remove_user

The ``remove-server-admin-permissions`` subcommand is used to remove a user from the ``server-admins`` group. Run the command once per user removed.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions USER_NAME

where ``USER_NAME`` is the user to remove from the list of server administrators.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions bob

returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   User bob was removed from server-admins. This user can no longer
   list, read, and create users for this Chef Server except for where
   they have default permissions (such as within an org).

.. end_tag

List Membership
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_list

The ``list-server-admins`` subcommand is used to return a list of users who are members of the ``server-admins`` group.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl list-server-admins

and will return a list of users similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

.. end_tag

Manage Organizations
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_chef_server_org

Use the ``org-create``, ``org-delete``, ``org-list``, ``org-show``, ``org-user-add`` and ``org-user-remove`` commands to manage organizations.

.. end_tag

org-create
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_org_create

The ``org-create`` subcommand is used to create an organization. (The validation key for the organization is returned to ``STDOUT`` when creating an organization with this command.)

.. end_tag

**Syntax**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_org_create_syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl org-create ORG_NAME "ORG_FULL_NAME" (options)

where:

* The name must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 1 and 255 characters. For example: ``chef``.
* The full name must begin with a non-white space character and must be between 1 and 1023 characters. For example: ``"Chef Software, Inc."``.

.. end_tag

**Options**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_org_create_options

This subcommand has the following options:

``-a USER_NAME``, ``--association_user USER_NAME``
   Associate a user with an organization and add them to the ``admins`` and ``billing_admins`` security groups.

``-f FILE_NAME``, ``--filename FILE_NAME``
   Write the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem to ``FILE_NAME`` instead of printing it to ``STDOUT``.

.. end_tag

org-delete
