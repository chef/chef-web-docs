Upgrade to |chef server_title| 12
=====================================================

The following sections describe the upgrade process for |chef server| 12.

.. note:: Be sure to back up the |chef server| data before starting the upgrade process.

From |chef server_title| 12
=====================================================
There are two upgrade scenarios for upgrades from earlier versions of |chef server| 12 to a newer version of |chef server| 12:

* `Standalone <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server.html#standalone>`__
* `High availability <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server.html#high-availability>`__

Standalone
-----------------------------------------------------
This section describes the upgrade process for a standalone configuration. The upgrade process will require downtime equal to the amount of time it takes to stop the server, run |debian dpkg| or |rpm|, and then upgrade the server.

.. include:: ../../includes_upgrade/includes_upgrade_standalone_12-to-12.rst

High Availability
-----------------------------------------------------
This section describes the upgrade process from a high availability configuration. The upgrade process will require downtime equal to the amount of time it takes to stop the server, run |debian dpkg| or |rpm|, and then upgrade the server.

.. include:: ../../includes_upgrade/includes_upgrade_ha_12-to-12.rst

From |chef server oec|
=====================================================
There are two upgrade scenarios for upgrades from |chef server oec| 11 to |chef server| 12: 

* `Standalone <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server.html#id1>`__
* `High availability <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server.html#id2>`__

Before upgrading, please `view the notes <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server_notes.html>`__ for more background on the upgrade process from |chef server oec| 11 to |chef server| 12.


Standalone
-----------------------------------------------------
This section describes the upgrade process from a standalone |chef server oec| 11 to |chef server| 12. The upgrade process will require downtime equal to the amount of time it takes to stop the server, run |debian dpkg| or |rpm|, and then upgrade the server. The final step will remove older components (like |couch db|) and will destroy the data after the upgrade process is complete.

.. include:: ../../includes_upgrade/includes_upgrade_standalone_11-to-12.rst

High Availability
-----------------------------------------------------
This section describes the upgrade process from a high availability |chef server oec| 11 to |chef server| 12. The upgrade process will require downtime equal to the amount of time it takes to stop the server, run |debian dpkg| or |rpm|, and then upgrade the server. The final step will remove older components (like |couch db|) and will destroy the data after the upgrade process is complete.

.. include:: ../../includes_upgrade/includes_upgrade_ha_11-to-12.rst

From |chef server osc|
=====================================================
This section describes the upgrade process from a standalone configuration of |chef server osc| 11.1.0 (or higher) to a standalone configuration of |chef server| 12. The upgrade process will require downtime equal to the amount of time it takes to stop the server, run |debian dpkg| or |rpm|, and then upgrade the server.

Please `view the notes <https://docs.chef.io/upgrade_server_open_source_notes.html>`__ for more background on the upgrade process from |chef server osc| 11 to |chef server| 12.

To upgrade to |chef server| 12 from the |chef server osc| server, do the following:

#. Run the following to make sure all services are in a sane state.

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Stop the |chef server osc| server:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl stop

#. Run |debian dpkg| or |rpm| on the server to install |chef server| 12. For |debian dpkg|:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ dpkg -D10 -i /path/to/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   where ``-D`` enables debugging and ``10`` creates output for each file that is processed during the upgrade. See the man pages for |debian dpkg| for more information about this option.
   
   For |rpm|:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ rpm -Uvh /path/to/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   |chef server| 12 is installed to ``/opt/opscode``. (The existing |chef server osc| remains at ``/opt/chef-server``.) From this point, the ``chef-server-ctl`` commands are running against the ``/opt/opscode`` location.

#. Upgrade the server with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl upgrade

   The upgrade process will automatically detect the presence of |chef server osc| 11, and will step through the migration process, prompting for organization name details along the way.

   The migration process will first download the existing data from the |chef server osc| server, transform that data into the format required for |chef server| 12, and then upload that data to the server.
   
#. Before data can be uploaded, an organization must be created. When prompted, enter the organization name, and then a full organization name.

   |name_rules org| For example: ``chef``.

   |name_rules org_full| For example: ``"Chef Software, Inc."``.

   .. note:: The upgrade process will automatically assign the organization name to the ``default_orgname`` setting in the |chef server rb| file. This setting ensures the new organization name is available for |api chef server| requests, such as those made by the |chef client| and by |knife|.

   .. warning:: If you receive a ``missing read permission`` error when running the ``knife user list`` subcommand after the upgrade process is finished, you will need to update the value for the ``chef_server_url`` setting in the |knife rb| file. The default value for that setting is:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         chef_server_url 'https://CHEF_SERVER_NAME:443/' 

      and should be updated to add ``organizations/ORG_NAME``:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         chef_server_url 'https://CHEF_SERVER_NAME:443/organizations/ORG_NAME'

#. The |chef server| is automatically restarted. A prompt is displayed that contains details about how to remove any temporary data that was created during the upgrade process.

#. .. include:: ../../includes_ctl_chef_server/includes_ctl_chef_server_install_features.rst

   **Update the Chef server URL**

   .. include:: ../../includes_upgrade/includes_upgrade_url_chef_server.rst

   .. note:: Any |chef client| or |knife| user that tries to access the |chef server| after the upgrade will be able to do so as long as the ``default_orgname`` is set and is part of the default organization on the upgraded |chef server|.

   **Use Downloads**

   .. include:: ../../includes_ctl_chef_server/includes_ctl_chef_server_install_features_download.rst

   **Use Local Packages**

   .. include:: ../../includes_ctl_chef_server/includes_ctl_chef_server_install_features_manual.rst



|chef manage_title|
=====================================================
|chef manage| can be upgraded as part of a standalone or high availability configuration:

#. After upgrading the |chef server|, run the following command on each of the front end servers for RHEL/CentOS:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install opscode-manage

   ubuntu needs the following to go from Manage 1.x to 2.x

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ apt-get install chef-manage



#. Reconfigure each of the front end servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-manage-ctl reconfigure



|push jobs_title|
=====================================================
|push jobs| can be upgraded as part of a standalone or high availability configuration:

#. After upgrading the |chef server|, run the following command on all front and back end servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install opscode-push-jobs-server

#. TCP protocol ports 10000-10003 must be open. This allows the |push jobs| clients to communicate with the |push jobs| server. In a configuration with both front and back ends, these ports only need to be open on the back end servers. The |push jobs| server waits for connections from the |push jobs| client (and never makes a connection to a |push jobs| client).

#. Reconfigure the |push jobs| servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Run the following command on each of the back end servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   This ensures that the |keepalived| scripts are regenerated so they are aware of |push jobs|.

#. Restart the |push jobs| components:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl restart opscode-pushy-server

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl test

#. Install the |push jobs| client on all nodes using the |cookbook push jobs| cookbook, as needed.
