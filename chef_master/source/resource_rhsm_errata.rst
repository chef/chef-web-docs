rhsm_errata resource
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/resource_rhsm_errata.rst>`__

Use the **rhsm_errata** resource to install packages associated with a given Red Hat Subscription Manager Errata ID. This is helpful if packages that mitigate a single vulnerability must be installed on your hosts.

**New in Chef Client 14.0.**

Syntax
=====================================================
The rhsm_errata resource has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

   rhsm_errata 'name' do
     errata_id                  String # default value: 'name'
     notifies                   # see description
     subscribes                 # see description
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified

where:

* ``rhsm_errata`` is the resource
* ``'name'`` is the Subscription Manager Errata ID, or the resource name
* ``errata_id``, ``notifies``, and ``subscribes`` are the properties available to this resource

Actions
=====================================================

The rhsm_errata resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install a package for a specific errata ID.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the Chef Client run.

   .. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
``errata_id``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Specify the Errata ID if it differs from the resource name.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the Chef Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of the Chef Client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag


Examples
=====================================================
**Install a package from an Errata ID**

.. code-block:: ruby

   rhsm_errata 'RHSA:2018-1234'

**Specify an Errata ID that differs from the resource name**

.. code-block:: ruby

   rhsm_errata 'errata-install'
     errata_id 'RHSA:2018-1234'
   end
