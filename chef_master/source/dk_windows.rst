Chef Workstation
=====================================================

Start your infrastructure automation quickly and easily with `Chef Workstation <https://www.chef.sh/>`__ Chef Workstation gives you everything you need to get started with Chef — ad hoc remote execution, remote scanning, configuration tasks, cookbook creation tools as well as robust dependency and testing software — all in one easy-to-install package.

Chef Workstation replaces ChefDK, combining all the existing features with new features, such as ad-hoc task support and the new Chef Workstation desktop application. Chef will continue to maintain ChefDK, but new development will take place in Chef Workstation without back-porting features.

Chef Workstation System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------

Minimum system requirements:

* RAM: 2GB
* Disk: 4GB
* Running minimum settings may limit your ability to take advantage of Chef
  Workstation tools such as Test Kitchen which creates and manages virtualized
  test environments.

Recommended system requirements:

* RAM: 4GB
* Disk 8GB

Chef Workstation App
-----------------------------------------------------

* Windows: No additional requirements
* Mac: No additional requirements
* Linux:
   - You must have a graphical window manager running
   - Additional libraries may be required. See `Running the Chef Workstation App <https://chef-workstation-app.html>`_ for more details.

Installing ChefDK
==================================================

In some cases, such as if you're working with older or unsupported systems, you may need to use ChefDK instead of Chef Workstation. Download ChefDK by following the installation instructions on `Installing ChefDK </install_dk.html>`_.

#. Visit the `ChefDK downloads page <https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk>`_ and select the appropriate package for your Windows version. Select the **Download** button.
#. Follow the steps to accept the license and install ChefDK. You will have the option to change your install location; by default the installer uses the ``C:\opscode\chefdk\`` directory.

Verify the Chef Workstation or ChefDK Installation
-----------------------------------------------------

To verify the ChefDK installation, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   chef -v

Which returns the versions of all installed Chef tools:

.. code-block:: shell

   ChefDK Version: 3.2.30
   chef-client version: 14.4.56
   berks version: 7.0.6
   kitchen version: 1.23.2
   InSpec version: 2.2.70

Spaces and Directories
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag windows_spaces_and_directories

Directories that are used by Chef on Windows cannot have spaces. For example, ``C:\Users\User Name`` will not work, but ``C:\Users\UserName`` will. Chef commands may fail if used against a directory with a space in its name.

.. end_tag

Top-level Directory Names
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag windows_top_level_directory_names

Windows will throw errors when path name lengths are too long. For this reason, it's often helpful to use a very short top-level directory, much like what is done in UNIX and Linux. For example, Chef uses ``/opt/`` to install ChefDK on macOS. A similar approach can be done on Microsoft Windows, by creating a top-level directory with a short name. For example: ``C:\chef``.

.. end_tag

Install a Code Editor
-------------------------------------------------------
A good visual code editor is not a requirement for working with Chef, but a good code editor can save you time.
A code editor should support the following: themes, plugins, snippets, syntax Ruby code coloring/highlighting, multiple cursors, a tree view of the entire folder/repository you are working with, and a Git integration.

These are a few common editors:

   * `Visual Studio Code (free/open source) <http://code.visualstudio.com>`__
   * `GitHub Atom - (free/open source) <http://atom.io>`__
   * `Sublime Text - ($80 USD) <http://sublimetext.com>`__

Chef support in editors:

   * `VSCode Chef Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pendrica.Chef>`__
   * `Chef on Atom <https://atom.io/packages/language-chef>`__
   * `Chef on Sublime Text <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pendrica.Chef>`__

Install and Optimize Git for Chef Development
-------------------------------------------------------
To install Git on Windows, navigate to the `Github Downloads <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__ site and download the Windows installer.

Download the installer and launch the Git Setup Wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions. We recommend adjusting the following settings to get the optimal set up for Chef development.

* When given the option to adjust your PATH environment you should select the option to ``Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt`` to ensure Git is available to all processes on the system, as shown in Figure
* When asked to configure the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash, select ``Use Windows`` default console window as shown in Figure 1-11 as this is most compatible with the command-line tools used in Chef development.
* When given the option for a Git integration, select your code editor from the list.

Install the Windows Tools
-------------------------------------------------------

 * `Azure-cli <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/downloads>`__
 *  `Azure Resource Manager Tools <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools>`__
 * If you are using Visual Studio Code, add the `Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/tools/>`__ for help with writing Azure Resource Manager JSON deployment templates.
 * `PowerShellGet <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-6.12.0>`__
