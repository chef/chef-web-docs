To install the Chef Compliance server in a standalone on-premises configuration, first review the prerequisites and then follow the steps below. Chef Compliance may also be installed as an Amazon Machine Images (AMI) from the AWS Marketplace.

.. note:: .. tag chef_subscriptions

          This feature is included as part of the Chef Automate license agreement and is `available via subscription <https://www.chef.io/pricing/>`_.

          .. end_tag

Prerequisites
=====================================================
The Chef Compliance server has the following prerequisites:

* An x86_64 compatible system architecture; Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS may require updates prior to installation
* A resolvable hostname that is specified using a FQDN or an IP address
* A connection to Network Time Protocol (NTP) to prevent clock drift
* Optional. A local user account under which services will run, a local user account for PostgreSQL, and a group account under which services will run. See https://docs.chef.io/install_server_pre.html#uids-and-gids for more information

The following prerequisites apply to every installation of the Chef Compliance server.

     - ``12.04 LTS``, ``14.04 LTS``

Untested Platforms
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Although you can audit many kinds of servers, the Chef Compliance server itself is not tested by Chef Software on the following platforms:

* Any Linux or UNIX distribution that is not listed as a supported platform
* Microsoft Windows
* 32-bit architectures

Standalone
=====================================================
The standalone installation of Chef Compliance server creates a working installation on a single server. This installation is also useful when you are installing Chef Compliance in a virtual machine, for proof-of-concept deployments, or as a part of a development or testing loop.

To install the Chef Compliance server:

#. Download the package from https://downloads.chef.io/compliance/.
#. Upload the package to the machine that will run the Chef Compliance server, and then record its location on the file system. The rest of these steps assume this location is in the ``/tmp`` directory
#. Install the Chef Compliance package on the server, using the name of the package provided by Chef. These commands require ``root`` privileges.

   For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-compliance-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-compliance-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef Compliance will be installed.

#. Run the following to start all of the services:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure

   .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_compliance

             Starting with Chef Compliance 1.1.9, the `Chef MLSA <https://docs.chef.io/chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

             .. end_tag

#. Access the Chef Compliance setup wizard.  Build the URL by prepending ``https://`` and appending ``/#/setup`` to the IP address or public hostname that was automatically assigned when the Amazon Machine Images (AMI) was launched.  For example, ``https://<fqdn>/#/setup``.

#. Run through the setup wizard, and then log in to Chef Compliance webui ``https://<fqdn>``.

AWS Marketplace
=====================================================
See https://docs.chef.io/aws_marketplace.html for more information.

Configure SSL
=====================================================
The Chef Compliance server can be configured to use SSL certificates by adding the following settings in the server configuration file located at ``/etc/chef-compliance/chef-compliance.rb``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``ssl['certificate']``
     - The SSL certificate used to verify communication over HTTPS.
   * - ``ssl['certificate_key']``
     - The certificate key used for SSL communication.

and then setting their values to define the paths to the certificate and key.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   ssl['certificate']  = "/etc/pki/tls/certs/your-host.crt"
   ssl['certificate_key']  = "/etc/pki/tls/private/your-host.key"

Save the file, and then run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure

Logging
=====================================================
.. tag compliance_logging

The default directory where Chef Compliance is saving logs is: ``/var/log/chef-compliance/``. It contains a directory for each service, but you can follow all the logs with this command:

.. code-block:: ruby

   sudo chef-compliance-ctl tail

This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chef-compliance-ctl tail core

.. end_tag

Troubleshooting
=====================================================
The following section describes troubleshooting tips for Chef Compliance installations.

Setup Button Does Not Work
-----------------------------------------------------
**Reason**

For security purposes the Chef Compliance setup wizard has a one hour timeout.

**Resolution**

#. Login using SSH to access the Chef Compliance instance.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ssh -i /path/to/ssh_key.pem <user>@<instance IP address>

#. Reconfigure Chef Compliance to restart the 60 minute setup timer.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure
