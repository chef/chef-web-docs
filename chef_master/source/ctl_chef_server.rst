.. tag ctl_chef_server_summary

The Chef server includes a command-line utility named chef-server-ctl. This command-line tool is used to start and stop individual services, reconfigure the Chef server, run chef-pedant, and then tail Chef server log files.

.. end_tag

Backup / Restore
=====================================================
Use the following commands to manage backups of Chef server data, and then to restore those backups.

backup
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_backup

The ``backup`` subcommand is used to back up all Chef server data. This subcommand:

* Requires rsync to be installed on the Chef server prior to running the command
* Requires a ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` prior to running the command
* Should not be run in a Chef server configuration with an external PostgreSQL database; `use knife ec backup <https://github.com/chef/knife-ec-backup>`__ instead
* Puts the initial backup in the ``/var/opt/chef-backup`` directory as a tar.gz file; move this backup to a new location for safe keeping

.. end_tag

**Options**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_backup_options

This subcommand has the following options:

``-y``, ``--yes``
   Use to specify if the Chef server can go offline during tar.gz-based backups.

.. end_tag

**Syntax**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_backup_syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl backup

.. end_tag

restore
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_restore

The ``restore`` subcommand is used to restore Chef server data from a backup that was created by the ``backup`` subcommand. This subcommand may also be used to add Chef server data to a newly-installed server. This subcommand:

* Requires rsync to be installed on the Chef server prior to running the command
* Requires a ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` prior to running the command
* Should not be run in a Chef server configuration with an external PostgreSQL database; `use knife ec backup <https://github.com/chef/knife-ec-backup>`__ instead

.. note :: The ``restore`` command does not support transferring backups across different versions of Chef server. Backups taken with the ``backup`` command must restore to the same version of Chef server that was in use when they were created.

.. end_tag

**Options**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_restore_options

This subcommand has the following options:

``-c``, ``--cleanse``
   Use to remove all existing data on the Chef server; it will be replaced by the data in the backup archive.

``-d DIRECTORY``, ``--staging-dir DIRECTORY``
   Use to specify that the path to an empty directory to be used during the restore process. This directory must have enough disk space to expand all data in the backup archive.

.. end_tag

**Syntax**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_restore_syntax

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl restore PATH_TO_BACKUP (options)

.. end_tag

**Examples**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl restore /path/to/tar/archive.tar.gz

backup-recover
=====================================================
The ``backup-recover`` subcommand is used to force the Chef server to attempt to become the backup server. This is the opposite of the ``master-recover`` subcommand.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl backup-recover

cleanse
=====================================================
The ``cleanse`` subcommand is used to re-set the Chef server to the state it was in prior to the first time the ``reconfigure`` subcommand is run. This command will destroy all data, configuration files, and logs. The software that was put on-disk by the package installation will remain; re-run ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` to recreate the default data and configuration files.

**Options**

This subcommand has the following options:

``--with-external``
   Use to specify that Chef server data on an external PostgreSQL database should be removed.

**Syntax**

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl cleanse

gather-logs
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_chef_server_gather_logs

* The Keepalived daemon is enabled in the config
* The DRBD process is enabled in the config
* The underlying block device or logical volume for DRBD has been created and configured
* The DRBD device exists
* The current state of the server is ``master`` or ``backup``; any migration processes have completed
* The failover virtual IP address is correctly attached to only the ``master`` node
* The DRBD state is correct based on the state of the server being ``master`` or ``backup``
* The DRBD mount point is correctly mounted to only the ``master`` node
* The DRBD replication IP addresses are pingable
* The ``runit`` status of the services are correct (up or down) based on the ``master`` or ``backup`` state of the server

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl ha-status

If this command runs successfully, it will return the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ [OK] all checks passed.

Otherwise it will print out a list of errors, similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   ...
   [OK] nginx is running correctly, and I am master.
   [ERROR] redis_lb is not running.
   [OK] opscode-erchef is running correctly, and I am master.
   ...
   [ERROR] ERRORS WERE DETECTED.

where ``name_of_addon`` represents the command line value associated with the add-on or premium feature.

.. end_tag

**Options**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_options

This subcommand has the following options:

``--path PATH``
   Use to specify the location of a package. This option is not required when packages are downloaded from https://packages.chef.io/.

.. end_tag

Use Downloads
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_download

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are not behind a firewall (and have connectivity to https://packages.chef.io/), these packages can be installed as described below.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Command
   * - Chef Manage
     - Use Chef management console to manage data bags, attributes, run-lists, roles, environments, and cookbooks from a web user interface.

       On the Chef server, run:

       .. code-block:: bash

          $ sudo chef-server-ctl install chef-manage

       then:

       .. code-block:: bash

          $ sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure

       and then:

       .. code-block:: bash

          $ sudo chef-manage-ctl reconfigure

       .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_manage

                 Starting with the Chef management console 2.3.0, the `Chef MLSA </chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

                 .. end_tag

.. end_tag

Use Local Packages
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_manual

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are behind a firewall (and may not have connectivity to packages.chef.io), these packages can be downloaded from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-manage/, and then installed manually. First download the package that is appropriate for the platform, save it to a local path, and then run the ``install`` command using the ``--path`` option to specify the directory in which the package is located:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install PACKAGE_NAME --path /path/to/package/directory

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install chef-manage --path /root/packages

The ``chef-server-ctl`` command will install the first ``chef-manage`` package found in the ``/root/packages`` directory.

cleanup-bifrost
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``cleanup-bifrost`` subcommand removes unused authorization objects from the authorization database (called bifrost).  These unused objects can accumulate on long-running Chef servers as a result of failed object creation requests.  For most users, the unused authorization objects do not substantially affect the performance of Chef server; however in certain situations it can be helpful to clean them up.  This command is primarily intended for use by Chef support.

New in Chef Server 12.16.9

**Syntax**

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl cleanup-bifrost OPTIONS

**Options**

This subcommand has the following options:

``--estimate-only``
   Provides an estimate of the number of unused objects that will be deleted, without deleting anything.
``--wait-time SECONDS``
   The number of seconds to wait for in-flight requests to complete.  Only decrease this value if you are running the command when the Chef server is not taking requests.
``--force-cleanup``
   Removes internal tracking tables used during the cleanup process.  Manual cleanup of these tables is only required if the cleanup command is killed unexpectedly.
``--batch-size`` 
   The number of orphaned authorization actors to delete at a time.

master-recover
=====================================================
The ``master-recover`` subcommand is used to force the Chef server to attempt to become the master server. This command is typically run in tandem with the ``backup-recover`` subcommand on the back-end peer, unless the back-end peer is no longer available.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. end_tag

Server Admins
=====================================================
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins

The ``server-admins`` group is a global group that grants its members permission to create, read, update, and delete user accounts, with the exception of superuser accounts. The ``server-admins`` group is useful for users who are responsible for day-to-day administration of the Chef server, especially user management via the ``knife user`` subcommand. Before members can be added to the ``server-admins`` group, they must already have a user account on the Chef server.

.. end_tag

Scenario
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins_scenario

The following user accounts exist on the Chef server: ``pivotal`` (a superuser account), ``alice``, ``bob``, ``carol``, and ``dan``. Run the following command to view a list of users on the Chef server:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl user-list

and it returns the same list of users:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

Alice is a member of the IT team whose responsibilities include day-to-day administration of the Chef server, in particular managing the user accounts on the Chef server that are used by the rest of the organization. From a workstation, Alice runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and it returns the following error:

.. code-block:: bash

   ERROR: You authenticated successfully to <chef_server_url> as alice
          but you are not authorized for this action
   Response: Missing read permission

Alice is not a superuser and does not have permissions on other users because user accounts are global to organizations in the Chef server. Let's add Alice to the ``server-admins`` group:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions alice

and it returns the following response:

.. code-block:: bash

   User alice was added to server-admins.

Alice can now create, read, update, and delete user accounts on the Chef server, even for organizations to which Alice is not a member. From a workstation, Alice re-runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

which now returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

Alice is now a server administrator and can use the following knife subcommands to manage users on the Chef server:

* ``knife user-create``
* ``knife user-delete``
* ``knife user-edit``
* ``knife user-list``
* ``knife user-show``

For example, Alice runs the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user edit carol -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and the $EDITOR opens in which Alice makes changes, and then saves them.

.. end_tag

Superuser Accounts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag server_rbac_server_admins_superusers

Superuser accounts may not be managed by users who belong to the ``server-admins`` group. For example, Alice attempts to delete the ``pivotal`` superuser account:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife user delete pivotal -c ~/.chef/alice.rb

and the following error is returned:

.. code-block:: bash

   ERROR: You authenticated successfully to <chef_server_url> as user1
          but you are not authorized for this action
   Response: Missing read permission

Alice's action is unauthorized even with membership in the ``server-admins`` group.

.. end_tag

Manage server-admins Group
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin

Membership of the ``server-admins`` group is managed with a set of ``chef-server-ctl`` subcommands:

* ``chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions``
* ``chef-server-ctl list-server-admins``
* ``chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions``

.. end_tag

Add Members
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_grant_user

The ``grant-server-admin-permissions`` subcommand is used to add a user to the ``server-admins`` group. Run the command once per user added.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions USER_NAME

where ``USER_NAME`` is the user to add to the list of server administrators.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions bob

returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   User bob was added to server-admins. This user can now list,
   read, and create users (even for orgs they are not members of)
   for this Chef Server.

.. end_tag

Remove Members
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_remove_user

The ``remove-server-admin-permissions`` subcommand is used to remove a user from the ``server-admins`` group. Run the command once per user removed.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions USER_NAME

where ``USER_NAME`` is the user to remove from the list of server administrators.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions bob

returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   User bob was removed from server-admins. This user can no longer
   list, read, and create users for this Chef Server except for where
   they have default permissions (such as within an org).

.. end_tag

List Membership
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_chef_server_server_admin_list

The ``list-server-admins`` subcommand is used to return a list of users who are members of the ``server-admins`` group.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl list-server-admins

and will return a list of users similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   pivotal
   alice
   bob
   carol
   dan

.. end_tag

show-config
=====================================================

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl uninstall

.. note:: To revert the ``uninstall`` subcommand, run the ``reconfigure`` subcommand (because the ``start`` subcommand is disabled by the ``uninstall`` command).

.. end_tag

upgrade

Service Subcommands
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_common_service_subcommands

This command has a built in process supervisor that ensures all of the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service and provides the following subcommands for managing services: ``hup``, ``int``, ``kill``, ``once``, ``restart``, ``service-list``, ``start``, ``status``, ``stop``, ``tail``, and ``term``.

.. end_tag

.. warning:: The following commands are disabled when an external PostgreSQL database is configured for the Chef server: ``hup``, ``int``, ``kill``, ``once``, ``restart``, ``start``, ``stop``, ``tail``, and ``term``.

hup
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_hup

The ``hup`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGHUP`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl hup SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

int
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_int

The ``int`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGINT`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl int SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

kill
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_kill

The ``kill`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGKILL`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl kill SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

once
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_once

The supervisor for the Chef server is configured to restart any service that fails, unless that service has been asked to change its state. The ``once`` subcommand is used to tell the supervisor to not attempt to restart any service that fails.

This command is useful when troubleshooting configuration errors that prevent a service from starting. Run the ``once`` subcommand followed by the ``status`` subcommand to look for services in a down state and/or to identify which services are in trouble. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl once SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

restart
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_restart

The ``restart`` subcommand is used to restart all services enabled on the Chef server or to restart an individual service by specifying the name of that service in the command.

.. warning:: When running the Chef server in a high availability configuration, restarting all services may trigger failover.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl restart SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully restarted the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

.. end_tag

service-list
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_service_list

The ``service-list`` subcommand is used to display a list of all available services. A service that is enabled is labeled with an asterisk (*).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl service-list

.. end_tag

start
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_start

The ``start`` subcommand is used to start all services that are enabled in the Chef server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl start SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully started the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

The supervisor for the Chef server is configured to wait seven seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If you see output that references a timeout, it means that a signal has been sent to the process, but that the process has yet to actually comply. In general, processes that have timed out are not a big concern, unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all. If a process is not responding, use a command like the ``kill`` subcommand to stop the process, investigate the cause (if required), and then use the ``start`` subcommand to re-enable it.

.. end_tag

status
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_status

The ``status`` subcommand is used to show the status of all services available to the Chef server. The results will vary based on the configuration of a given server. This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl status

and will return the status for all services. Status can be returned for individual services by specifying the name of the service as part of the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl status SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

When service status is requested, the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ run: service_name: (pid 12345) 12345s; run: log: (pid 1234) 67890s

where

* ``run:`` is the state of the service (``run:`` or ``down:``)
* ``service_name:`` is the name of the service for which status is returned
* ``(pid 12345)`` is the process identifier
* ``12345s`` is the uptime of the service, in seconds

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ down: opscode-erchef: (pid 35546) 10s

By default, runit will restart services automatically when the services fail. Therefore, runit may report the status of a service as ``run:`` even when there is an issue with that service. When investigating why a particular service is not running as it should be, look for the services with the shortest uptimes. For example, the list below indicates that the **opscode-erchef** should be investigated further:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: oc-id
   run: opscode-chef: (pid 4327) 13671s; run: log: (pid 4326) 13671s
   run: opscode-erchef: (pid 5383) 5s; run: log: (pid 4382) 13669s
   run: opscode-expander: (pid 4078) 13694s; run: log: (pid 4077) 13694s
   run: opscode-expander-reindexer: (pid 4130) 13692s; run: log: (pid 4114) 13692s

On back-end servers in a high availability topology, Keepalived is used by the clustering service to determine whether a service should be running. If the ``status`` subcommand is run against any of these nodes, a few things change:

* On the back-end node that is currently the backup server, it is normal to see only one running process: Keepalived
* On the back-end node that is currently the master server, it is normal to see all services running. It is also normal to see some services in a down state if the server, on reboot, did not attempt to start the services because Keepalived determines which services are restarted based on the state of the cluster

A sample status line for a service that is running on the master server in a high availability topology:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: opscode-solr4: (pid 25341) 239s, normally down; run: log: (pid 5700) 145308s

.. end_tag

A typical status line for a service that is running any of the Chef server front-end services is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s

where:

* ``run`` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep processes. This state is either ``run`` or ``down``. If a service is in a ``down`` state, it should be stopped
* ``name_of_service`` is the service name, for example: ``opscode-solr4``
* ``(pid 1486) 7819s;`` is the process identifier followed by the amount of time (in seconds) the service has been running
* ``run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s`` is the log process. It is typical for a log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   down: opscode-solr4: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s

where

* ``down`` indicates that the service is in a down state
* ``3s, normally up;`` indicates that the service is normally in a run state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service after a reboot

stop
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_stop

The ``stop`` subcommand is used to stop all services enabled on the Chef server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl stop SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully stopped the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: diwb: service_name: 0s, normally up

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl stop

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   ok: down: nginx: 393s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-chef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-erchef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander: 390s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander-reindexer: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-solr4: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: postgresql: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: rabbitmq: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: redis_lb: 387s, normally up

.. end_tag

tail
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_tail

The ``tail`` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef server logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl tail SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

term
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_chef_server_term

The ``term`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGTERM`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl term SERVICE_NAME

where ``SERVICE_NAME`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag
