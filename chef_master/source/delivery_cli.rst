Delivery CLI
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/delivery_cli.rst>`__

The Delivery CLI is the command-line interface for the workflow capabilities in Chef Automate. It sits in-between a local git repository and the Chef Automate server.

Install Delivery CLI
=====================================================
.. tag delivery_cli_install

The Delivery CLI is required for the workstation and for many Chef Automate functions. It is included in ChefDK and can be obtained by `installing the latest version </install_dk.html>`__.

.. note:: You must delete your old Delivery CLI if you installed it prior to it being included in ChefDK.

.. end_tag

Configure Delivery CLI
=====================================================
.. tag delivery_cli_configure

Before you use the Delivery CLI from a workstation, you need to provide it with details such as the URL of the Chef Automate server, and the names of the relevant enterprise, organization, and user. The ``delivery setup`` subcommand creates a configuration file named ``.delivery/cli.toml`` with the required information.

The placement of the ``.delivery`` directory in your file hierarchy is significant. Like git, Delivery CLI commands search the current directory and parent directories to locate server settings. Because server settings are unique to an organization, we recommend that you create a directory for each organization you belong to and run the ``delivery setup`` command from that directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery setup --server=DELIVERY_SERVER_IP_ADDR --ent=ENTERPRISE --org=ORGANIZATION --user=USERNAME

The following settings may be added to the ``.delivery/cli.toml`` file:

``auto_bump``
   Bumps the cookbook metadata version number automatically when ``delivery review`` is run. Default value: ``false``.

.. end_tag

Run Delivery CLI in FIPS Mode
=====================================================
.. tag fips_intro

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are federal standards for computer systems used by contractors of government agencies and non-military government agencies.

FIPS 140-2 is a specific federal government security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. Chef Automate uses the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module, which satisfies the requirements of software cryptographic modules under the FIPS 140-2 standard. The OpenSSL Object Module provides an API for invoking FIPS approved cryptographic functions from calling applications.

.. end_tag

See the main `FIPS documentation </fips.html>`__ for more information on what FIPS is and how to enable it.

.. tag delivery_cli_fips

How to enable FIPS mode for the Chef Automate server
==================================================================

Prerequisites
------------------------------------------------------------------
* Supported Systems - CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7
* Chef Automate version ``0.7.100`` or greater

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have FIPS compliance enabled in the operating system at the kernel level
and install or reconfigure the Chef Automate server then it will default to
running in FIPS mode.

A Chef Automate server running in FIPS mode can only communicate with workstations that are
also running in FIPS mode.

If you do need to use FIPS mode, there are a few steps to get it up and running in Delivery CLI on your workstation.

Check if Chef Automate server has enabled FIPS mode
-----------------------------------------------------

You can see if your Chef Automate server is in FIPS mode by running ``delivery status``. It will say ``FIPS mode: enabled`` if it is enabled as well as output some instructions on how to set up
your ``cli.toml`` to enable FIPS mode locally. If ``delivery status`` reports either ``FIPS mode: disabled`` or FIPS is missing completely from the report, please see `FIPS kernel settings </fips.html#fips-kernel-settings>`_ on how to enable FIPS mode in your Chef Automate server before proceeding.

Enable FIPS mode in your cli.toml file
-----------------------------------------------------

Now that you have confirmed that the Chef Automate server is in FIPS mode, you must enable FIPS mode locally on your workstation for Delivery CLI.
This can be done by adding the following to your ``.delivery/cli.toml``:

.. code-block:: none

   fips = true
   fips_git_port = "OPEN_PORT"
   fips_custom_cert_filename = "/full/path/to/your/certificate-chain.pem" # optional

Replace ``OPEN_PORT`` with any port that is free locally on localhost.

If you are using a custom certificate authority or a self-signed certificate then you will need the third option. This file should contain to the entire certificate chain in `pem` format. See `FIPS Certificate Management </fips#certificate_management>`_ for an example on how to generate the file.

How to enable FIPS mode for workstations
==================================================================

A workstation is a computer running ChefDK that is used to author cookbooks, interact with the Chef Infra Server, and interact with nodes.

Prerequisites
------------------------------------------------------------------
* Supported Systems - Windows, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* ChefDK version ``1.3.23`` or greater

Now that FIPS mode is enabled in your ``.delivery/cli.toml``, running any project-specific Delivery CLI command will automatically use FIPS-compliant encrypted git traffic between your
workstation and the Chef Automate server. As long as the Chef Automate server is in FIPS mode, no other action is needed on your part to operate Delivery CLI in FIPS mode.
If you ever stop using FIPS mode on the Chef Automate server, simply delete the above two lines from your ``.delivery/cli.toml`` file and Delivery CLI will stop running in FIPS mode.

.. note:: You could also pass ``--fips`` and ``--fips-git-port=OPEN_PORT`` into project specific commands if you do not wish to edit your ``.delivery/cli.toml``. See list of commands below for details..

.. end_tag

**Add build-cookbook from private Supermarket**

The following example shows how to add a build cookbook after the initialization process

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery init —skip-build-cookbook

and then update the ``config.json`` file for the ``delivery-truck`` cookbook and the path to the cookbook in a private Chef Supermarket:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "version": "2",
     "build_cookbook": {
       "name": "delivery-truck",
       "supermarket": "true",
       "site": "https://private-supermarket.example.com"
     },
     ...
   }

**Initialize project with custom pipeline**

To initialize a project using a GitHub repository, run a command similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery init --generator PATH_TO_COOKBOOK -c PATH_TO_CONFIG -f PIPELINE

where ``PATH_TO_COOKBOOK`` is path to the cookbook generator, ``PATH_TO_CONFIG`` is the path to a ``config.json`` file, and ``PIPELINE`` is the name of a pipeline in Chef Automate. For example to initialize a pipeline using the ``bc-generator`` cookbook generator and the ``trunk`` pipeline:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery init --generator https://github.com/albertatom/bc-generator.git -c /Users/albertatom/chef/delivery/.delivery/config.json -f trunk

   Running handlers complete
   Chef Client finished, 2/2 resources updated in 32.770955 seconds

delivery local
=====================================================
Use the ``local`` subcommand to run a phase or stage of Chef Automate locally, based on settings in the ``project.toml`` file located in the project's ``.delivery`` directory.

.. note:: As of ChefDK 1.2, delivery local now supports options for functional phases, running stages, and specifying a remote ``project.toml``.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery local PHASE|STAGE

where ``PHASE`` is one of the following:

* lint
* syntax
* unit
* provision
* deploy
* smoke
* functional
* cleanup

and ``STAGE`` will execute a series of phases in the following order:
* verify: [lint, syntax, unit]
* acceptance: [provision, deploy, smoke, functional, cleanup]
* all: [lint, syntax, unit, provision, deploy, smoke, functional, cleanup]

Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------

**Phases**

Phases are defined in the ``project.toml`` file in the following format:

.. code-block:: ruby

   [local_phases]
   name_of_phase = "command to execute locally"

Example configuration for commands to run locally:

.. code-block:: ruby

   [local_phases]
   unit = "rspec spec/"
   lint = "cookstyle"
   syntax = "foodcritic . --exclude spec -f any -t \"~FC064\" -t \"~FC065\""

**Remote project.toml**

You can use a ``project.toml`` file located in a remote location by specifying a URI in the following format:

.. code-block:: ruby

   remote_file = "https://url-for-my-project.toml"

This is useful for teams that wish to centrally manage the behavior of the ``delivery local`` command across many different projects. Alternatively, you can provide the URI via the ``-r`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery local syntax -r https://url-for-my-project.toml

Providing the URI through this manner will take precedence over anything configured in the local ``project.toml``.

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------

**Run Foodcritic**

If the ``project.toml`` file contains:

.. code-block:: ruby

   unit = "rspec spec/"
   lint = "cookstyle"
   syntax = "foodcritic . --exclude spec -f any -t \"~FC064\" -t \"~FC065\""
   provision = "chef exec kitchen create"
   deploy = "chef exec kitchen converge"
   smoke = "chef exec kitchen verify"
   cleanup = "chef exec kitchen destroy"

the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery local syntax

will run Foodcritic and execute the following command locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ foodcritic . --exclude spec -f any -t \"~FC064\" -t \"~FC065\"


**Run Verify Stage**

If the ``project.toml`` file contains:

.. code-block:: ruby

   unit = "rspec spec/"
   lint = "cookstyle"
   syntax = "foodcritic . --exclude spec -f any -t \"~FC064\" -t \"~FC065\""
   provision = "chef exec kitchen create"
   deploy = "chef exec kitchen converge"
   smoke = "chef exec kitchen verify"
   cleanup = "chef exec kitchen destroy"

the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery local verify

will run lint, syntax and unit phases in that order:

.. code-block:: bash

   Chef Delivery

delivery review
=====================================================
Use the ``review`` subcommand to submit a feature branch for review as a new patchset. This either creates a new change associated with the feature branch, or adds a new patchset on an existing change in the pipeline. When the new patchset has been created, the Verify stage for the associated change is automatically triggered and runs the unit, lint and syntax phases. By default, this action opens a browser window to show the pipeline in Chef Automate.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery review (options)

This subcommand has the following options:

``-a``, ``--auto-bump``
   Bumps the cookbook metadata version number automatically when ``delivery review`` is run.

``--edit``
