Install ChefDK
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/install_dk.rst>`__

Use the ChefDK installer to set up ChefDK on a workstation. ChefDK includes the Chef Infra Client, an embedded version of Ruby, RubyGems, and OpenSSL, as well as our tools: Test Kitchen, Cookstyle, Foodcritic and ChefSpec. The Chef installer puts everything into a unique directory (``/opt/chefdk/`` on macOS / Linux and ``C:\opscode\chefdk\`` on Windows) so that these components will not interfere with other applications that may be running on the target machine.

.. note:: The Chef installer must run as a privileged user.

.. note:: `Chef Workstation <https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/>`__ gives you everything you need to get started with Chef — ad hoc remote execution, remote scanning, configuration tasks, cookbook creation tools as well as robust dependency and testing software — all in one easy-to-install package. Chef Workstation replaces ChefDK, combining all the existing features with new features, such as ad-hoc task support and the new Chef Workstation desktop application. Chef will continue to maintain ChefDK, but new development will take place in Chef Workstation without backporting features.

Install
=====================================================

macOS
-----------------------------------------------------

.. note:: ChefDK works without installing Xcode, but Xcode is required for native Ruby Gem installation. Run ``xcode-select --install`` from the terminal to install Xcode.

#. Visit the `ChefDK downloads page <https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk#mac_os_x>`__ and select the appropriate package for your macOS version. Click on the **Download** button.
#. Follow the steps to accept the license and install ChefDK. You will have the option to change your install location; by default the installer uses the ``/opt/chefdk/`` directory.

Windows
-----------------------------------------------------
#. Visit the `ChefDK downloads page <https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk#windows>`__ and select the appropriate package for your Windows version. Click on the **Download** button.
#. Follow the steps to accept the license and install ChefDK. You will have the option to change your install location; by default the installer uses the ``C:\opscode\chefdk\`` directory.
#. **Optional:** Set the default shell. On Microsoft Windows it is strongly recommended to use Windows PowerShell and ``cmd.exe``.

See the `ChefDK on Windows </dk_windows.html>`__ guide for additional caveats and configuration options specific to Windows.
