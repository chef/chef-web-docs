.. tag policyfile_summary

A Policyfile is an optional way to manage role, environment, and community cookbook data with a single document that is uploaded to the Chef server. The file is associated with a group of nodes, cookbooks, and settings. When these nodes perform a Chef client run, they utilize recipes specified in the Policyfile run-list.

.. note:: Consider the following before using Policyfiles:

   * Policyfile is not supported as part of a Chef Automate workflow
   * Policyfile is intended to be used with Chef server 12.3 or above, and Chef client 12.8 or above

.. end_tag

.. tag policyfile_rb

A Policyfile file allows you to specify in a single document the cookbook revisions and recipes that should be applied by the chef-client. A Policyfile file is uploaded to the Chef server, where it is associated with a group of nodes. When these nodes are configured by the chef-client, the chef-client will make decisions based on settings in the policy file, and will build a run-list based on that information. A Policyfile file may be versioned, and then promoted through deployment stages to safely and reliably deploy new configuration.

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag policyfile_rb_syntax

A ``Policyfile.rb`` is a Ruby file in which run-list and cookbook locations are specified. The syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   name "name"
   run_list "ITEM", "ITEM", ...
   default_source :SOURCE_TYPE, *args
   cookbook "NAME" [, "VERSION_CONSTRAINT"] [, SOURCE_OPTIONS]

.. end_tag

Settings
=====================================================
.. tag policyfile_rb_settings

A ``Policyfile.rb`` file may contain the following settings:

``name "name"``
   Required. The name of the policy. Use a name that reflects the purpose of the machines against which the policy will run.

``run_list "ITEM", "ITEM", ...``
   Required. The run-list the chef-client will use to apply the policy to one (or more) nodes.

``default_source :SOURCE_TYPE, *args``
   The location in which any cookbooks not specified by ``cookbook`` are located. Possible values: ``chef_repo``, ``chef_server``, ``:community``, ``:supermarket``, and ``:artifactory``. Use more than one ``default_source`` to specify more than one location for cookbooks.

   ``default_source :supermarket`` pulls cookbooks from the public Chef Supermarket.

   ``default_source :supermarket, "https://mysupermarket.example"`` pulls cookbooks from a named private Chef Supermarket.

   ``default_source :chef_server, "https://chef-server.example/organizations/example"`` pulls cookbooks from the Chef Server.

   ``default_source :community`` is an alias for ``:supermarket``.

   ``default_source :chef_repo, "path/to/repo"`` pulls cookbooks from a monolithic cookbook repository. This may be a path to the top-level of a cookbook repository or to the ``/cookbooks`` directory within that repository.

   ``default_source :artifactory, "https://artifactory.example/api/chef/my-supermarket"`` pulls cookbooks from an Artifactory server. Requires either ``artifactory_api_key`` to be set in ``knife.rb`` or ``ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY`` to be set in your environment.

   Multiple cookbook sources may be specified. For example from the public Chef Supermarket and a monolithic repository:

   .. code-block:: ruby

	  default_source :supermarket
	  default_source :chef_repo, "path/to/repo"

   or from both a public and private Chef Supermarket:

   .. code-block:: ruby

	  default_source :supermarket
	  default_source :supermarket, "https://supermarket.example"

   .. note:: If a run-list or any dependencies require a cookbook that is present in more than one source, be explicit about which source is preferred. This will ensure that a cookbook is always pulled from an expected source. For example, an internally-developed cookbook named ``chef-client`` will conflict with the public ``chef-client`` cookbook that is maintained by Chef. To specify a named source for a cookbook:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         default_source :supermarket
         default_source :supermarket, "https://supermarket.example" do |s|
           s.preferred_for "chef-client"
         end

      List multiple cookbooks on the same line:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         default_source :supermarket
         default_source :supermarket, "https://supermarket.example" do |s|
           s.preferred_for "chef-client", "nginx", "mysql"
         end

``cookbook "NAME" [, "VERSION_CONSTRAINT"] [, SOURCE_OPTIONS]``
   Add cookbooks to the policy, specify a version constraint, or specify an alternate source location, such as Chef Supermarket. For example, add a cookbook:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook "apache2"

   Specify a version constraint:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      run_list "jenkins::master"

      # Restrict the jenkins cookbook to version 2.x, greater than 2.1
      cookbook "jenkins", "~> 2.1"

   Specify an alternate source:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook 'my_app', path: 'cookbooks/my_app'

   or:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook 'mysql', github: 'opscode-cookbooks/mysql', branch: 'master'

   or:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook 'chef-ingredient', git: 'https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-ingredient.git', tag: 'v0.12.0'

``named_run_list "NAME", "ITEM1", "ITEM2", ...``
   Specify a named run-list to be used as an alternative to the override run-list. This setting should be used carefully and for specific use cases, like running a small set of recipes to quickly converge configuration for a single application on a host or for one-time setup tasks. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      named_run_list :update_app, "my_app_cookbook::default"

``include_policy "NAME", *args``
   **New in Chef DK 2.4** Specify a policyfile lock to be merged with this policy. Chef DK supports pulling this lock from a local file or from Chef server. When the policyfile lock is included, its run-lists will appear before the current policyfile's run-list. This setting requires that the solved cookbooks appear as-is from the included policyfile lock. If conflicting attributes or cookbooks are provided, an error will be presented. See `RFC097 <https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md>`__ for the full specifications of this feature.


  Pull the policyfile lock from ``./NAME.lock.json``:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     include_policy "NAME", path: "."

  Pull the policyfile lock from ``./foo.lock.json``.

  .. code-block:: ruby

     include_policy "NAME", path: "./foo.lock.json"

  Pull the policy ``NAME`` with revision ID ``revision1`` from the ``http://chef-server.example`` Chef server:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     include_policy "NAME", policy_revision_id: "revision1", server: "http://chef-server.example"

  Pull the policy ``foo`` with revision ID ``revision1``:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     include_policy "NAME", policy_name: "foo", policy_revision_id: "revision1", server: "http://chef-server.example"

  Pull and lock the current revision for policy ``foo`` in policy group ``prod``:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     include_policy "NAME", policy_name: "foo", policy_group: "prod", server: "http://chef-server.example"

.. end_tag

Example
=====================================================
.. tag policyfile_rb_example

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   name "jenkins-master"
   run_list "java", "jenkins::master", "recipe[policyfile_demo]"
   default_source :supermarket, "https://mysupermarket.example"
   cookbook "policyfile_demo", path: "cookbooks/policyfile_demo"
   cookbook "jenkins", "~> 2.1"
   cookbook "mysql", github: "chef-cookbooks/mysql", branch: "master"

.. end_tag
