Use `Test Kitchen <https://kitchen.ci/>`_  to automatically test cookbook data across any combination of platforms and test suites:

* Defined in a kitchen.yml file
* Uses a driver plugin architecture
* Supports cookbook testing across many cloud providers and virtualization technologies
* Supports all common testing frameworks that are used by the Ruby community
* Uses a comprehensive set of base images provided by `Bento <https://github.com/chef/bento>`_


.. tag test_kitchen_yml

Use a kitchen.yml file to define what is required to run Kitchen, including drivers, provisioners, platforms, and test suites.

Syntax
==========================================================================
.. tag test_kitchen_yml_syntax

The basic structure of a kitchen.yml file is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: driver_name

   provisioner:
     name: provisioner_name

   verifier:
     name: verifier_name

   transport:
     name: transport_name

   platforms:
     - name: platform-version
       driver:
         name: driver_name
     - name: platform-version

   suites:
     - name: suite_name
       run_list:
         - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]
       attributes: { foo: "bar" }
       excludes:
         - platform-version
     - name: suite_name
       driver:
         name: driver_name
       run_list:
         - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]
       attributes: { foo: "bar" }
       includes:
         - platform-version

where:

* ``driver_name`` is the name of a driver that will be used to create platform instances used during cookbook testing. This is the default driver used for all platforms and suites **unless** a platform or suite specifies a ``driver`` to override the default driver for that platform or suite; a driver specified for a suite will override a driver set for a platform
* ``provisioner_name`` specifies how the chef-client will be simulated during testing. ``chef_zero``  and ``chef_solo`` are the most common provisioners used for testing cookbooks
* ``verifier_name`` specifies which application to use when running tests, such as ``inspec``
* ``transport_name`` specifies which transport to use when executing commands remotely on the test instance. ``winrm`` is the default transport on Windows. The ``ssh`` transport is the default on all other operating systems.
* ``platform-version`` is the name of a platform on which Kitchen will perform cookbook testing, for example, ``ubuntu-16.04`` or ``centos-7``; depending on the platform, additional driver details---for example, instance names and URLs used with cloud platforms like OpenStack or Amazon EC2---may be required
* ``platforms`` may define Chef server attributes that are common to the collection of test suites
* ``suites`` is a collection of test suites, with each ``suite_name`` grouping defining an aspect of a cookbook to be tested. Each ``suite_name`` must specify a run-list, for example:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     run_list:
       - recipe[cookbook_name::default]
       - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]

* Each ``suite_name`` grouping may specify ``attributes`` as a Hash: ``{ foo: "bar" }``
* A ``suite_name`` grouping may use ``excludes`` and ``includes`` to exclude/include one (or more) platforms. For example:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     excludes:
        - platform-version
        - platform-version       # for additional platforms

For example, a very simple kitchen.yml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero

   platforms:
     - name: ubuntu-16.04
     - name: centos-7
     - name: debian-9

  suites:
    - name: default
      run_list:
        - recipe[apache::httpd]
      excludes:
        - debian-9

This file uses Vagrant as the driver, which requires no additional configuration because it's the default driver used by Kitchen, chef-zero as the provisioner, and a single (default) test suite that runs on Ubuntu 16.04, and CentOS 7.

.. end_tag

Provisioner Settings
==========================================================================
Test Kitchen's provisioner settings will be changing in a future version. See `Chef RFC 091 <https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc091-deprecate-kitchen-settings.md>`_
for details. Settings that will be deprecated are listed in the descriptions below. The new recommended settings are listed in the `New Provisioner Settings </config_yml_kitchen.html#new-provisioner-settings>`__ table.

Kitchen can configure the chef-zero provisioner with the following Chef-specific settings:

Transport Settings
==========================================================================
Kitchen can configure a transport with the following settings for either ``ssh`` or ``winrm`` transports:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``connection_retries``
     - Maximum number of times to retry after a failed attempt to open a connection. The default is 5.
   * - ``connection_retry_sleep``
     - Number of seconds to wait until attempting to make another connection after a failure.
   * - ``max_wait_until_ready``
     - Maximum number of attempts to determine if the test instance is ready to accept commands. This defaults to 600.
   * - ``password``
     - The password used for authenticating to the test instance.
   * - ``port``
     - The port used to connect to the test instance. This defaults to ``22`` for the ``ssh`` transport and ``5985`` or ``5986`` for ``winrm`` using ``http`` or ``https`` respectively.
   * - ``username``
     - The username used for authenticating to the test instance. This defaults to ``administrator`` for the ``winrm`` transport and ``root`` for the ``ssh`` transport. Some drivers may change this default.

These settings may be added to the ``transport`` section of the kitchen.yml file when the transport is SSH:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``compression``
     - Wether or not to use compression. The default is ``false``.
   * - ``compression_level``
     - The default is 6 if ``compression`` is ``true``.
   * - ``connection_timeout``
     - Defaults to 15.
   * - ``keepalive``
     - Defaults to ``true``.
   * - ``keepalive_interval``

   * - ``max_ssh_sessions``
     - Maximum number of parallel ssh sessions.
   * - ``ssh_key``
     - Path to an ssh key identity file.

These settings may be added to the ``transport`` section of the kitchen.yml file when the transport is WinRM:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``elevated``
     - When ``true``, all commands are executed via a scheduled task. This may eliminate access denied errors related to double hop authentication, interacting with windows updates and installing some MSIs such as sql server and .net runtimes. Defaults to ``false``.
   * - ``elevated_password``
     - The password used by the identity running the scheduled task. This may be ``null`` in the case of service accounts. Defaults to ``password``.
   * - ``elevated_username``
     - The identity that the task runs under. This may also be set to service accounts such as ``System``. This defaults to ``username``.
   * - ``rdp_port``
     - Port used making ``rdp`` connections for ``kitchen login`` commands. Defaults to 3389.
   * - ``winrm_transport``
     - The transport type used by winrm as explained `here <https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM>`__. The default is ``negotiate``. ``ssl`` and ``plaintext`` are also acceptable values.

Work with Proxies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. tag test_kitchen_yml_syntax_proxy

The environment variables ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, and ``ftp_proxy`` are honored by Kitchen for proxies. The client.rb file is read to look for proxy configuration settings. If ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, and ``ftp_proxy`` are specified in the client.rb file, the chef-client will configure the ``ENV`` variable based on these (and related) settings. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   http_proxy 'http://proxy.example.org:8080'
   http_proxy_user 'myself'
   http_proxy_pass 'Password1'

will be set to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   ENV['http_proxy'] = 'http://myself:Password1@proxy.example.org:8080'

Kitchen also supports ``http_proxy`` and ``https_proxy`` in the ``kitchen.yml`` file. You can set them manually or have them read from your local environment variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero
     # Set proxy settings manually, or
     http_proxy: 'http://user:password@server:port'
     https_proxy: 'http://user:password@server:port'

     # Read from local environment variables
     http_proxy: <%= ENV['http_proxy'] %>
     https_proxy: <%= ENV['https_proxy'] %>

This will not set the proxy environment variables for applications other than Chef. The Vagrant plugin, `vagrant-proxyconf <http://tmatilai.github.io/vagrant-proxyconf/>`__, can be used to set the proxy environment variables for applications inside the VM.

.. end_tag

chef-client Settings
==========================================================================
A kitchen.yml file may define chef-client-specific settings, such as whether to require the Chef installer or the URL from which the chef-client is downloaded, or to override settings in the client.rb file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero *or* chef_solo
     require_chef_omnibus: true
     chef_omnibus_url: https://www.chef.io/chef/install.sh

   ...

   suites:
     - name: config
       run_list:
       ...
       attributes:
         chef_client:
           load_gems:
             chef-handler-updated-resources:
               require_name: "chef/handler/updated_resources"
           config:
             log_level: ":debug"
             ssl_verify_mode: ":verify_peer"
             start_handlers: [{class: "SimpleReport::UpdatedResources", arguments: []}]
             report_handlers: [{class: "SimpleReport::UpdatedResources", arguments: []}]
             exception_handlers: [{class: "SimpleReport::UpdatedResources", arguments: []}]
         ohai:
           disabled_plugins: ["passwd"]

where:

* ``require_chef_omnibus`` is used to ensure that the Chef installer will be used to install the chef-client to all platform instances; ``require_chef_omnibus`` may also be set to ``latest``, which means the newest version of the chef-client for that platform will be used for cookbook testing
* ``chef_omnibus_url`` is used to specify the URL from which the chef-client is downloaded
* All of the ``attributes`` for the ``config`` test suite contain specific client.rb settings for use with this test suite

Driver Settings
==========================================================================
Driver-specific configuration settings may be required. Use a block similar to:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: driver_name
     optional_settings: values

Specific ``optional_settings: values`` may be specified.

Bento
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. tag bento

`Bento <https://github.com/chef/bento>`_ is a project that contains a set of base images that are used by Chef for internal testing and to provide a comprehensive set of base images for use with Kitchen. By default, Kitchen uses the base images provided by Bento. (Custom images may also be built using Packer.)

.. end_tag

Drivers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. tag test_kitchen_drivers

Kitchen uses a driver plugin architecture to enable Kitchen to simulate testing on cloud providers, such as Amazon EC2, OpenStack, and Rackspace, and also on non-cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Windows. Each driver is responsible for managing a virtual instance of that platform so that it may be used by Kitchen during cookbook testing.

.. note:: The Chef development kit includes the ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver.

Most drivers have driver-specific configuration settings that must be added to the kitchen.yml file before Kitchen will be able to use that platform during cookbook testing. For information about these driver-specific settings, please refer to the driver-specific documentation.

kitchen-vagrant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. tag test_kitchen_driver_vagrant

The ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver for Kitchen generates a single Vagrantfile for each instance of Kitchen in a sandboxed directory. The ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver supports VirtualBox and VMware Fusion, requires Vagrant 1.1.0 (or higher), and is the default driver for Test Kitchen.

.. end_tag

.. tag test_kitchen_driver_vagrant_settings

The following attributes are used to configure ``kitchen-vagrant`` for Chef:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``box``
     - Required. Use to specify the box on which Vagrant will run. Default value: computed from the platform name of the instance.
   * - ``box_check_update``
     - Use to check for box updates. Default value: ``false``.
   * - ``box_url``
     - Use to specify the URL at which the configured box is located. Default value: computed from the platform name of the instance, but only when the Vagrant provider is VirtualBox- or VMware-based.
   * - ``communicator``
     - Use to override the ``config.vm.communicator`` setting in Vagrant. For example, when a base box is a Microsoft Windows operating system that does not have SSH installed and enabled, Vagrant will not be able to boot without a custom Vagrant file. Default value: ``nil`` (assumes SSH is available).
   * - ``customize``
     - A hash of key-value pairs that define customizations that should be made to the Vagrant virtual machine. For example: ``customize: memory: 1024 cpuexecutioncap: 50``.
   * - ``guest``
     - Use to specify the ``config.vm.guest`` setting in the default Vagrantfile.
   * - ``gui``
     - Use to enable the graphical user interface for the defined platform. This is passed to the ``config.vm.provider`` setting in Vagrant, but only when the Vagrant provider is VirtualBox- or VMware-based.
   * - ``network``
     - Use to specify an array of network customizations to be applied to the virtual machine. Default value: ``[]``. For example: ``network: - ["forwarded_port", {guest: 80, host: 8080}] - ["private_network", {ip: "192.168.33.33"}]``.
   * - ``pre_create_command``
     - Use to run a command immediately prior to ``vagrant up --no-provisioner``.
   * - ``provider``
     - Use to specify the Vagrant provider. This value must match a provider name in Vagrant.
   * - ``provision``
     - Use to provision Vagrant when the instance is created. This is useful if the operating system needs customization during provisioning. Default value: ``false``.
   * - ``ssh_key``
     - Use to specify the private key file used for SSH authentication.
   * - ``synced_folders``
     - Use to specify a collection of synchronized folders on each Vagrant instance. Source paths are relative to the Kitchen root path. Default value: ``[]``. For example: ``synced_folders: - ["data/%{instance_name}", "/opt/instance_data"] - ["/host_path", "/vm_path", "create: true, type: :nfs"]``.
   * - ``vagrantfile_erb``
     - Use to specify an alternate Vagrant Embedded Ruby (ERB) template to be used by this driver.
   * - ``vagrantfiles``
     - An array of paths to one (or more) Vagrant files to be merged with the default Vagrant file. The paths may be absolute or relative to the kitchen.yml file.
   * - ``vm_hostname``
     - Use to specify the internal hostname for the instance. This is not required when connecting to a Vagrant virtual machine. Set this to ``false`` to prevent this value from being rendered in the default Vagrantfile. Default value: computed from the platform name of the instance.

.. end_tag

.. tag test_kitchen_driver_vagrant_config

The ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver can predict the box name for Vagrant and the download URL that have been published by Chef. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   platforms:
   - name: ubuntu-16.04
   - name: ubuntu-18.04
   - name: centos-6
   - name: centos-7
   - name: debian-9

which will generate a configuration file similar to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   platforms:
   - name: ubuntu-16.04
     driver:
       box: bento/ubuntu-16.04
   - name: ubuntu-18.04
     driver:
       box: bento/ubuntu-18.04
   # ...

The following examples show actual kitchen.yml files used in Chef-maintained cookbooks.

Chef, Chef DK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following example shows the provisioner settings needed to install the Chef development kit, and then use the version of Chef that is embedded in the Chef development kit to converge the node.

To install the latest version of the Chef development kit:

.. code-block:: yaml

   provisioner:
     ...
     chef_omnibus_install_options: -P chefdk
     chef_omnibus_root: /opt/chefdk

and to install a specific version of the Chef development kit:

.. code-block:: yaml

   provisioner:
     ...
     chef_omnibus_install_options: -P chefdk
     chef_omnibus_root: /opt/chefdk
     require_chef_omnibus: 3.2.0

Microsoft Windows Platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following example shows platform settings for the Microsoft Windows platform:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---

   platforms:
     - name: eval-win2012r2-standard
       os_type: windows
       transport:
         name: winrm
         elevated: true

If ``name`` begins with ``win`` then the ``os_type`` defaults to ``windows``. The ``winrm`` transport is the default on Windows operating systems. Here ``elevated`` is true which runs windows commands via a scheduled task to imitate a local user.

chef-client, audit-mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following example shows provisioner settings for running the chef-client in audit-mode:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   driver:
     name: vagrant
     customize:
       memory: 1024
       cpus: 2

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero
     client_rb:
       audit_mode: :enabled

   platforms:
     - name: ubuntu-18.04
       run_list:
         - recipe[audit-cis::ubuntu1804-100]
     - name: centos-7
       run_list:
         - recipe[audit-cis::centos7-100]
     - name: centos-6
       run_list:
       - recipe[audit-cis::centos6-110]

   suites:
     - name: default

where ``audit_mode`` may be ``:enabled``, ``:disabled`` (default), or ``:audit_only``.

mysql Cookbook
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most impressive (and thorough) kitchen.yml file is part of the ``mysql`` cookbook. It is too big to paste into this topic, so please see it at the following links:

     attributes: {}

chef-splunk Cookbook
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following kitchen.yml file is part of the ``chef-splunk`` cookbook and is used to help ensure the installation of the Splunk client and server is done correctly.

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant
     customize:
       memory: 1024

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero

yum Cookbook
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following kitchen.yml file is part of the ``yum`` cookbook:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero

   platforms:
     - name: centos-6
     - name: centos-7

Platform Attributes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following kitchen.yml file sets up a simple tiered configuration of the Chef server, including two front-end servers, a single back-end server, and all three add-ons (Chef push jobs, Reporting, and Chef management console). The ``platforms`` block uses an ``attributes`` section to define Chef server-specific attributes that are used by all three test suites:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   driver:
     name: vagrant

   provisioner:
     name: chef_zero

   platforms:
     - name: ubuntu-16.04
       attributes:
         chef-server:
           api_fqdn: backend.chef-server.com
           backend:
             fqdn: backend.chef-server.com

             frontend2.chef-server.com: 123.456.789.0
           urls:
             private_chef: http://123.456.789.0/path/to/private-chef_11.1.4-1_amd64.deb

   suites:
     - name: frontend1
       driver:
         vm_hostname: frontend1.chef-server.com
         network:
         - ["private_network", {ip: "123.456.789.0"}]
         customize:
           memory: 2048
           cpus: 2

         customize:
           memory: 2048
           cpus: 2
       run_list:

         - recipe[chef-server::server]
         - recipe[chef-server::backend]

Kitchen Converge On System Reboot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test-Kitchen can handle reboots (when initiated from chef-client) by setting ``retry_on_exit_code``, ``max_retries`` and ``wait_for_retry`` attributes on the provisioner in ``kitchen.yml`` file as follows :

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   provisioner:
      name: chef_zero
      require_chef_omnibus: 12.11 # need the RFC 062 exit codes
      retry_on_exit_code:
        - 35 # 35 is the exit code signaling that the node is rebooting
        - 1
      max_retries: 1
      client_rb:
        exit_status: :enabled # Opt-in to the standardized exit codes
        client_fork: false  # Forked instances don't return the real exit code

**One note on linux nodes**: The shutdown command blocks (as opposed to the windows variant which registers the reboot and returns right away), so once the timeout period passes, chef-client and the node are in a race to see who can exit/shutdown first - so you may or may not get the exit code out of linux instances. In that case, you can add ``1`` to the ``retry_on_exit_code`` array and that should catch both cases.

Please refer `YAML documentation <https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections>`__ to set ``retry_on_exit_code`` attribute.
