          .. end_tag

Prerequisites
=====================================================
Before installing the Chef server software, perform the following steps:

#. Use an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Amazon EC2-Classic is not supported.
#. Create appropriate security groups to contain the backend instances. The only requirement for the Chef server is that ICMP is permitted between the two backend instances; Keepalived requires it for communication and heartbeat.
#. Launch two servers, one for the primary backend Chef server and the other for the secondary backend Chef server. Use the same Amazon Machine Images (AMI) so that both backend servers have identical platform and versions. The servers must be in the same availability zones.
#. Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume to store the Chef server's data. It is recommended that you use an EBS Provisioned IOPS volume type, with the maximum IOPS ratio for the size of volume.
#. Choose an IP address for the backend virtual IP (VIP). It must reside in the same network segment as the backend instances and must be `assignable as a secondary private IP address <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html>`__ to the primary backend Chef server. The IP address is specified in the chef-server.rb file. During installation, the high-availability plugin will automatically assign the VIP to the elastic network interface (ENI) for the primary instance.
#. Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with at least the permissions documented in the reference section. Record this user's access and secret keys; these will be used in the chef-server.rb configuration file.
#. Enable sticky sessions on the load balancer. Configure all instances of the Chef management console to point to one Redis load balancer instance.

Primary Backend
=====================================================
Use the following steps to set up the primary backend Chef server:

#. Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume and attach it to the primary backend.
#. Download https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/. You will also need the chef-ha package; however, that can no longer be downloaded from https://downloads.chef.io.
#. Install the ``chef-server-core`` package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed.
#. Install ``chef-ha`` package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-ha-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-ha-<version>.deb

#. Create a file named chef-server.rb that is located in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory. See the chef-server.rb section below for an example of the settings and values that are required. The ``ha['ebs_device']`` setting must specify the actual ``/dev`` device name that is reported by the machine's kernel, which may not be the same value that is reported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) may refer to a volume as ``/dev/sdf`` through the management console, but to the Linux kernel on the instance, it may appear as ``/dev/xvdf``.

#. Install logical volume manager (LVM) tools. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install lvm2

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install lvm2

#. Create a physical volume, volume group, and logical volume with the following series of commands. The volume group and logical volume names must be ``chef`` and ``data``, respectively.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo vgcreate chef /dev/xvdf

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo lvcreate -l 85%VG -n data chef

#. Format and mount the new volume with the following series of commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/opscode/drbd/data

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/chef-data

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo mount /dev/mapper/chef-data /var/opt/opscode/drbd/data

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

   This will reconfigure the Chef server, start Keepalived, assign the VIP IP address as a secondary address on the elastic network interface (ENI), and then configure the machine as the primary backend server.

#. Verify the machine is the primary backend server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl ha-status

   This should display a screen of output indicating that the server is ``PRIMARY`` and that all services are running.

   Additionally, you may run the following command to verify that the VIP IP address is configured on the Ethernet interface:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ip addr list dev eth0

   .. warning:: Do *not* use the ``ifconfig`` command as it will not show all aliases.

chef-server.rb
=====================================================
Each Chef server in a high availability configuration must have an identical chef-server.rb file that is located in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory on each server. This file describes the topology of the high availability configuration. On the primary backend server, create a file named chef-server.rb and save it in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory.

Add the following settings to the chef-server.rb file:

#. Define the topology type:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      topology "ha"

#. Define the primary backend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "backend",
        :bootstrap => true,
        :cluster_ipaddress => "CLUSTER_IPADDRESS"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the server and ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server. The role is a backend server is ``"backend"``. If the backend server is used to bootstrap the Chef server installation, replace ``CLUSTER_IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the interface that is used for cluster communications. For example, the same IP address that is used by Keepalived and DRBD. If the Chef server is not used to bootstrap the Chef server installation, exclude the ``:cluster_ipaddress`` entry.

#. Define the secondary backend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IPADDRESS",
        :role => "backend",
        :cluster_ipaddress => "CLUSTER_IPADDRESS"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the server, and ``IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server. Replace ``CLUSTER_IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server's interface assigned for cluster communications. If no such interface is configured, exclude the ``cluster_ipaddress`` entry.

#. Define the backend virtual IP address:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      backend_vip "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :device => "eth0",

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the server. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the virtual IP address of the server. The ``:device`` parameter should be the ethernet interface to which the floater virtual IP address will bind. This is typically the public interface of the server.

#. Define each frontend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "frontend"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the frontend server. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the frontend server. Set ``:role`` to ``"frontend"``.

   Add separate entry in the chef-server.rb file for each frontend server.

#. Define the API FQDN:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      api_fqdn "FQDN"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the FQDN of the load balanced virtual IP address, which should be equal to the FQDN for the service URI that is used by the Chef server.

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

Secondary Backend
=====================================================
Use the following steps to set up the secondary backend Chef server:

#. Install the ``chef-server-core`` package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed.
#. Install ``chef-ha`` package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-ha-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-ha-<version>.deb

#. Install logical volume manager (LVM) tools. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install lvm2

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install lvm2

#. Create the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory, and then copy the contents of the entire ``/etc/opscode`` directory from the primary server, including all certificates and the chef-server.rb.

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

   This will reconfigure the Chef server, start Keepalived, and configure it as the secondary backend server.

#. Verify the secondary backend server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl ha-status

   This should indicate that the server is ``BACKUP``.

Verify Failover
=====================================================
To verify that failover is working, stop Keepalived on the primary server.

#. To watch the failover occur as it happens, run the following command in terminal windows on both the primary and secondary backend servers prior to stopping Keepalived:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ watch -n1 sudo chef-server-ctl ha-status

   in terminal windows on both the primary and secondary servers prior to stopping Keepalived.

#. Stop Keepalived on the primary backend server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl stop keepalived

   A cluster failover should occur.

#. After a successful failover, restart Keepalived on the primary backend server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl start keepalived

   The primary has now become the secondary, and vice-versa. If you wish to fail back to the original primary, repeat these using the new primary.

Frontend Installation
=====================================================
Use the following steps to set up each frontend Chef server:

#. Install the ``chef-server-core`` package. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   For Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed. The Chef high availability package is **not** required on front end machines.

#. Create the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory, and then copy the entire contents of the ``/etc/opscode`` directory from the primary backend server, including all certificates and the chef-server.rb file.

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

#. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl start

#. .. tag ctl_chef_server_user_create_admin

   Run the following command to create an administrator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl user-create USER_NAME FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME EMAIL 'PASSWORD' --filename FILE_NAME

   An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the user's private key and should be saved to a safe location. The ``--filename`` option will save the RSA private key to the specified absolute path.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl user-create janedoe Jane Doe janed@example.com 'abc123' --filename /path/to/janedoe.pem

   .. end_tag

#. .. tag ctl_chef_server_org_create_summary

   Run the following command to create an organization:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl org-create short_name 'full_organization_name' --association_user user_name --filename ORGANIZATION-validator.pem

   For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo chef-server-ctl org-create 4thcoffee 'Fourth Coffee, Inc.' --association_user janedoe --filename /path/to/4thcoffee-validator.pem

   The name must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 1 and 255 characters. For example: ``4thcoffee``.

   The full name must begin with a non-white space character and must be between 1 and 1023 characters. For example: ``'Fourth Coffee, Inc.'``.

   The ``--association_user`` option will associate the ``user_name`` with the ``admins`` security group on the Chef server.

   An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the chef-validator key and should be saved to a safe location. The ``--filename`` option will save the RSA private key to the specified absolute path.

   .. end_tag

#. .. tag install_chef_server_reconfigure

   .. This topic is hooked in globally to install topics for Chef server applications.

   Reconfigure the Chef server and the Chef management console (standalone and frontend group members
     of a High Availabilty installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   .. end_tag

Enable Features
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features

Enable additional features of the Chef server! The packages may be downloaded directly as part of the installation process or they may be first downloaded to a local directory, and then installed.

.. end_tag

**Use Downloads**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_download_ha

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are not behind a firewall (and have connectivity to https://packages.chef.io/), the Chef management console package can be installed as described below:

Chef Manage
   Use Chef management console to manage data bags, attributes, run-lists, roles, environments, and cookbooks from a web user interface.

   On each front end server in the Chef server configuration, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install chef-manage

   then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-manage-ctl reconfigure

   This updates the Chef server and creates the ``/etc/opscode-manage/secrets.rb`` file. When running the Chef management console 1.11 (or higher), copy the ``secrets.rb`` file in the ``/etc/opscode-manage`` directory on one of the frontend servers to the same directory on each of the other frontend servers, and then rerun ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` so the copied ``/etc/opscode-manage/secrets.rb`` file gets used correctly.

   .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_manage

             Starting with the Chef management console 2.3.0, the `Chef MLSA </chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

             .. end_tag

.. end_tag

**Use Local Packages**

.. tag ctl_chef_server_install_features_manual

The ``install`` subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default. For systems that are behind a firewall (and may not have connectivity to packages.chef.io), these packages can be downloaded from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-manage/, and then installed manually. First download the package that is appropriate for the platform, save it to a local path, and then run the ``install`` command using the ``--path`` option to specify the directory in which the package is located:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install PACKAGE_NAME --path /path/to/package/directory

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo chef-server-ctl install chef-manage --path /root/packages

The ``chef-server-ctl`` command will install the first ``chef-manage`` package found in the ``/root/packages`` directory.

.. end_tag

**Install Reporting**

.. tag install_reporting_ha

To set up the Reporting server:

#. Install the package on each frontend and backend Chef server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl install opscode-reporting

#. Reconfigure the Chef server on the backend primary server (bootstrap):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Reconfigure the Reporting server on the backend primary server (bootstrap):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure

   .. note:: .. tag chef_license_reconfigure_reporting

             Starting with Reporting 1.6.0, the `Chef MLSA </chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.

             .. end_tag

#. Copy the entire ``/etc/opscode-reporting`` directory from the backend primary server to all frontend and backend servers. For example, from each server run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r <Bootstrap server IP>:/etc/opscode-reporting /etc

   or from the backend primary server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r /etc/opscode-reporting <each servers IP>:/etc

#. Reconfigure any Chef server on which Reporting services have been installed:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Reconfigure Reporting services on each server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-reporting-ctl test

.. end_tag

**Install Push Jobs**

.. tag install_push_jobs_server_ha

To set up the Chef push jobs server for a high availability configuration:

#. Install the package on all servers that are running the Chef server. For example on Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo dpkg -i opscode-push-jobs-server_2.1.0-1_amd64.deb

#. Reconfigure the primary backend Chef push jobs server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Copy the entire ``/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server`` directory from the backend primary to all frontend and backend servers. For example, from each server run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r <Bootstrap server IP>:/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server /etc

   or from the backend primary server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ scp -r /etc/opscode-push-jobs-server <each servers IP>:/etc

#. TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10003 must be open. These are the heartbeat and command ports respectively. They allow the Chef push jobs server to communicate with the Chef push jobs clients. In a configuration with both frontend and backend servers, these ports only need to be open on the backend servers. The Chef push jobs server waits for connections from the Chef push jobs client (and never makes a connection to a Chef push jobs client).

#. Reconfigure the remaining Chef push jobs servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Run the following command on each of the backend servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

   This ensures that the Keepalived scripts are regenerated so they are aware of Chef push jobs.

#. Restart all servers on which Chef push jobs will run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl restart opscode-pushy-server

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl test

.. end_tag

Reference
=====================================================
The following sections show the Chef high availability settings as they appear in a chef-server.rb file and required permissions of the user in Identity and Access Management (IAM).

chef-server.rb
-----------------------------------------------------
The following example shows a chef-server.rb file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   topology "ha"
   ha['provider'] = 'aws'
   ha['aws_access_key_id'] = '[DELETED]'
   ha['aws_secret_access_key'] = '[DELETED]'
   ha['ebs_volume_id'] = 'vol-xxxxx'
   ha['ebs_device'] = '/dev/xvdf'

   server 'ip-172-31-24-97.us-west-1.compute.internal',
     :ipaddress => '172.31.24.97',
     :role => 'backend',
     :bootstrap => true

   server 'ip-172-31-24-98.us-west-1.compute.internal',
     :ipaddress => '172.31.24.98',
     :role => 'backend'

   backend_vip 'ip-172-31-24-180.us-west-1.compute.internal',
     :ipaddress => '172.31.24.180',
     :device => 'eth0',
     :heartbeat_device => 'eth0'

   server 'ip-172-31-30-47.us-west-1.compute.internal',
     :ipaddress => '172.31.30.47',
     :role => 'frontend'

   api_fqdn 'ec2-54-183-175-188.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com'

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
-----------------------------------------------------
The following example shows Identity and Access Management (IAM) access management settings that are required for Chef high availability:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
           "ec2:AttachVolume",
           "ec2:DetachVolume",
           "ec2:AssignPrivateIpAddresses"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

It is possible to further restrict access using a more sophisticated policy document. For example, administrators may choose to permit the Identity and Access Management (IAM) user only to attach/detach the volume ID associated with the Chef server data volume, and not all volumes.
