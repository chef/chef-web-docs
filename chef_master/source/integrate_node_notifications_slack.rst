.. danger:: This documentation covers an outdated version of Chef Automate. See the `Chef Automate site <https://www.chef.io/automate/quickstart>`__ for current documentation. The new Chef Automate includes newer out-of-the-box compliance profiles, an improved compliance scanner with total cloud scanning functionality, better visualizations, role-based access control and many other features.

Chef Automate may be configured to notify a particular Slack channel or user when it detects certain issues with the nodes you are managing. Currently, those issues include:

* A Chef client run failure on any node in your fleet.
* A critical InSpec compliance scan failure on any node in your fleet.

Integrating Chef Automate with Slack requires a webhook to be created in Slack, and then saving that webhook in Chef Automate. Currently, any user of Chef Automate may create and manage notifications. Notifications sent to Slack by Chef Automate will respect any outbound proxy settings
that you may have configured in your `delivery.rb` file. For more information on the proxy settings in Chef Automate, see `Proxy Settings <https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_delivery.html#proxy-settings>`_. 

.. note:: Notifications sent to Slack by Chef Automate do not support retries; therefore, notifications sent while Slack is experiencing API issues, outages, or some other unplanned downtime may never be received by the channel. Undelivered notifications are not re-sent. Attempts to send notifications do generate log messages in your Chef Automate server.

To create a webhook in Slack:

#. Navigate to `Incoming Webhooks <https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks>`__ in Slack and select the team that you want to be associated with Chef Automate.
#. Select **Add Configuration**.
#. Under **Post to Channel**, select the channel in Slack where Chef Automate will send notifications.
#. Click **Add Incoming Webhooks Integration**. Slack will create the new webhook and then provide a webhook URL for you to copy.
