kitchen is the command-line tool for Kitchen, an integration testing tool used by the chef-client. Kitchen runs tests against any combination of platforms using any combination of test suites. Each test, however, is done against a specific instance, which is comprised of a single platform and a single set of testing criteria. This allows each test to be run in isolation, ensuring that different behaviors within the same codebase can be tested thoroughly before those changes are committed to production.

.. note:: Any Kitchen subcommand that does not specify an instance will be applied to all instances.

.. note:: This topic details functionality that is packaged with Chef development kit. See http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/ for more information about Kitchen.

Fuzzy Matching
=====================================================
Fuzzy matching can be used with all commands because kitchen uses regular expressions to search. For example, a fully qualified name:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen list default-ubuntu-1404 --bare

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   client-ubuntu-1404

A partial name:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen list ubuntu --bare

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   client-ubuntu-1404
   server-ubuntu-1404

A short string:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen list ub --bare

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   client-ubuntu-1404
   server-ubuntu-1404

An integer:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen list 4 --bare

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   client-ubuntu-1404
   server-ubuntu-1404

A single-quoted Ruby regular expression:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen list '^cli.*-65$' --bare

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   client-centos-65

kitchen converge
=====================================================
Use the ``converge`` subcommand to converge one (or more) instances. Instances are based on the list of platforms in the .kitchen.yml file. This process will install the chef-client on an instance using the omnibus installer, upload cookbook files and minimal configuration to the instance, and then start a chef-client run using the run-list and attributes specified in the .kitchen.yml file.

Kitchen will skip unnecessary steps. For example, if the chef-client is already installed to the instance, Kitchen will not re-install the chef-client. That said, Kitchen will always upload the cookbook files and minimal configuration. This ensures that cookbook testing is being done correctly.

The following exit codes are used by Kitchen:

* ``0`` means the operation was successful
* Any non-zero value means at least one part of the operation was unsuccessful

In general, use the ``test`` subcommand to verify the end-to-end quality of a cookbook. Use the ``converge`` and ``verify`` subcommands during the normal the day-to-day development of a cookbook.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen converge PLATFORMS (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following options:

``-c``, ``--concurrency``
   The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: ``9999`` (all instances, effectively).

``-l``, ``--log-level``
   The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): ``:debug``, ``:info``, ``:warn``, ``:error``, and ``:fatal``. Default: ``info``.

``PLATFORMS``
   Run Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the .kitchen.yml file. Use ``all`` to run Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

   .. tag ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms

   For example, if a .kitchen.yml file contains the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       - name: centos-5.10
       - name: centos-6.5
       - name: fedora-19
       - name: ubuntu-1004
       - name: ubuntu-1204
       - name: ubuntu-1310

   then a regular expression like ``(04|5)`` would run Kitchen against ``centos-5.10``, ``centos-6.5``, ``ubuntu-1004``, and ``ubuntu-1204``. A regular expression like ``(ubuntu)`` would run Kitchen against ``ubuntu-1004``, ``ubuntu-1204``, and ``ubuntu-1310``. A regular expression like ``(fedora-19)`` would run Kitchen against only ``fedora-19``. Default: ``all``.

   .. end_tag

kitchen create
=====================================================
Use the ``create`` subcommand to create one (or more) instances. Instances are based on the list of platforms and suites in the .kitchen.yml file.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen create PLATFORMS (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following options:

``-c``, ``--concurrency``
   The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: ``9999`` (all instances, effectively).

``-l``, ``--log-level``
   The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): ``:debug``, ``:info``, ``:warn``, ``:error``, and ``:fatal``. Default: ``info``.

``PLATFORMS``
   Run Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the .kitchen.yml file. Use ``all`` to run Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

   .. tag ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms

   For example, if a .kitchen.yml file contains the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       - name: centos-5.10
       - name: centos-6.5
       - name: fedora-19
       - name: ubuntu-1004
       - name: ubuntu-1204
       - name: ubuntu-1310

   then a regular expression like ``(04|5)`` would run Kitchen against ``centos-5.10``, ``centos-6.5``, ``ubuntu-1004``, and ``ubuntu-1204``. A regular expression like ``(ubuntu)`` would run Kitchen against ``ubuntu-1004``, ``ubuntu-1204``, and ``ubuntu-1310``. A regular expression like ``(fedora-19)`` would run Kitchen against only ``fedora-19``. Default: ``all``.

   .. end_tag

kitchen destroy
=====================================================
Use the ``destroy`` subcommand to delete one (or more) instances. Instances are based on the list of platforms and suites in the .kitchen.yml file.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen destroy PLATFORMS (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following options:

``-c``, ``--concurrency``
   The number of allowed concurrent connections. Default: ``9999`` (all instances, effectively).

``-l``, ``--log-level``
   The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): ``:debug``, ``:info``, ``:warn``, ``:error``, and ``:fatal``. Default: ``info``.

``PLATFORMS``
   Run Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the .kitchen.yml file. Use ``all`` to run Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

   .. tag ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms

   For example, if a .kitchen.yml file contains the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       - name: centos-5.10
       - name: centos-6.5
       - name: fedora-19
       - name: ubuntu-1004
       - name: ubuntu-1204
       - name: ubuntu-1310

   then a regular expression like ``(04|5)`` would run Kitchen against ``centos-5.10``, ``centos-6.5``, ``ubuntu-1004``, and ``ubuntu-1204``. A regular expression like ``(ubuntu)`` would run Kitchen against ``ubuntu-1004``, ``ubuntu-1204``, and ``ubuntu-1310``. A regular expression like ``(fedora-19)`` would run Kitchen against only ``fedora-19``. Default: ``all``.

   .. end_tag

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------
None.

kitchen diagnose
=====================================================
Use the ``diagnose`` subcommand to show a computed diagnostic configuration for one (or more) instances. This subcommand will make all implicit configuration settings explicit because it echoes back all of the configuration data as YAML.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen diagnose PLATFORMS (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following options:

``--all``
   Include all diagnostics. Default: ``false``.

``--instances``
   Include instance diagnostics. Default: ``true``.

``-l``, ``--log-level``
   The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Options (in order of priority): ``:debug``, ``:info``, ``:warn``, ``:error``, and ``:fatal``. Default: ``info``.

``--loader``
   Include data loader diagnostics. Default: ``false``.

``PLATFORMS``
   Run Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the .kitchen.yml file. Use ``all`` to run Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

   .. tag ctl_kitchen_common_option_platforms

   For example, if a .kitchen.yml file contains the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       - name: centos-5.10
       - name: centos-6.5
       - name: fedora-19
       - name: ubuntu-1004
       - name: ubuntu-1204
       - name: ubuntu-1310

   then a regular expression like ``(04|5)`` would run Kitchen against ``centos-5.10``, ``centos-6.5``, ``ubuntu-1004``, and ``ubuntu-1204``. A regular expression like ``(ubuntu)`` would run Kitchen against ``ubuntu-1004``, ``ubuntu-1204``, and ``ubuntu-1310``. A regular expression like ``(fedora-19)`` would run Kitchen against only ``fedora-19``. Default: ``all``.

   .. end_tag

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------

**Diagnose an instance**

Use the ``--loader`` option to include diagnostic data in the output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   loader:
     combined_config:
       filename:
       raw_data:
         driver:
           name: vagrant
           socket: tcp://192.168.12.34:1234
       provisioner:
        #...

or:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   loader:
     global_config:
       filename: "/Users/username/.kitchen/config.yml"
       raw_data: #...
     project_config:
       filename: "/Users/username/Projects/sandbox/path/to/kitchen.yml"
       raw_data: #...
     local_config:

**Diagnose an instance using --instances option**

Use the ``--instances`` option to track instances, which are based on the list of platforms and suites in the .kitchen.yml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   instances
     default-ubuntu-1204
       busser:
         root_path: /tmp/busser
         ruby_bindir: /opt/chef/embedded/bin
         sudo: true

**Diagnose an instance using --loader option**

This command returns data as YAML:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kitchen exec PLATFORMS (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This subcommand has the following options:

``-c REMOTE_COMMAND``
   Use to specify a remote command to be run via SSH.

``PLATFORMS``
   Run Kitchen against one or more platforms listed in the .kitchen.yml file. Use ``all`` to run Kitchen against all platforms. Use a Ruby regular expression to glob two or more platforms into a single run.

   1 gem installed

kitchen list
=====================================================
Use the ``list`` subcommand to view the list of instances. Instances are based on the list of platforms in the .kitchen.yml file. Kitchen will auto-name instances by combining a suite name with a platform name. For example, if a suite is named ``default`` and a platform is named ``ubuntu-10.04``, then the instance would be ``default-ubuntu-10.04``. This ensures that Kitchen instances have safe DNS and hostname records.
