To define |oauth| 2 information for both |chef analytics| and |supermarket|, create a |ruby hash| similar to:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      oc_id['applications'] ||= {}
      oc_id['applications']['analytics'] = {
        'redirect_uri' => 'https://analytics.rhel.aws'
      }
      oc_id['applications']['supermarket'] = {
        'redirect_uri' => 'https://vagrantup.com/auth'
      }
