The front-end for the Chef Infra Server is written using
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), which is a programming language that
[first appeared in
1986](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29),
was open sourced in 1998, and is excellent with critical enterprise
concerns like concurrency, fault-tolerance, and distributed
environments. The Chef Infra Server can scale to the size of any
enterprise and is sometimes referred to as Erchef.
