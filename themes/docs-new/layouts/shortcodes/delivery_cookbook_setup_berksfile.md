The Berksfile for a `build-cookbook` is located at
`.delivery/build-cookbook/Berksfile`. Update it to include:

```ruby
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'

metadata

cookbook 'delivery-truck', github: 'chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck'
cookbook 'delivery-sugar', github: 'chef-cookbooks/delivery-sugar'
```

This will ensure that the latest versions of the `delivery-truck` and
`delivery-sugar` cookbooks are pulled into the `build-cookbook` every
time a change is sent to the Chef Automate project pipeline.
