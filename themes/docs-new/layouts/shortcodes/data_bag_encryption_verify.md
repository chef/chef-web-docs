When the contents of a data bag item are encrypted, they will not be
readable until they are decrypted. Encryption can be verified with a
knife command similar to:

```bash
knife data bag show passwords mysql
```

where "passwords" is the name of the data bag and "mysql" is the name of
the data bag item. This will return something similar to:

```none
id:   mysql
pass:
cipher:         aes-256-cbc
encrypted_data: JZtwXpuq4Hf5ICcepJ1PGQohIyqjNX6JBc2DGpnL2WApzjAUG9SkSdv75TfKSjX4
