A `build-cookbook` should define the same phases as the recipes included
in the `delivery-truck` cookbook: `default.rb`, `deploy.rb`,
`functional.rb`, `lint.rb`, `provision.rb`, `publish.rb`, `quality.rb`,
`security.rb`, `smoke.rb`, `syntax.rb`, and `unit.rb`. For example, a
build cookbook's recipe directory should contain an identical list of
recipes. For example, run:

```bash
ls .delivery/build-cookbook/recipes/
```

the list of recipes should be:

```bash
default.rb
deploy.rb
functional.rb
lint.rb
provision.rb
publish.rb
quality.rb
security.rb
smoke.rb
syntax.rb
unit.rb
```

Each recipe corresponds to a specific phase in the Chef Automate
pipeline. The recipes in the `build-cookbook` should include the
same-named recipe in the `delivery-truck` cookbook. For example, to
include the `lint.rb` recipe from the `delivery-truck` cookbook, update
the `lint.rb` recipe in the `build-cookbook` to add the following:

```ruby
include_recipe 'delivery-truck::lint'
```

and then add to the `unit.rb` recipe:

```none
include_recipe 'delivery-truck::unit'
```

and so on for all of the recipes. This ensures that all of the default
behavior for all of the phases for the entire pipeline is available to
this `build-cookbook`.
