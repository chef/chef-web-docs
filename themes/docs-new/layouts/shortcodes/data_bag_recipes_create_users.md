Chef Infra Client can create users on systems based on the contents of a
data bag. For example, a data bag named "admins" can contain a data bag
item for each of the administrators that will manage the various systems
that each Chef Infra Client is maintaining. A recipe can load the data
bag items and then create user accounts on the target system with code
similar to the following:

```ruby
# Load the keys of the items in the 'admins' data bag
admins = data_bag('admins')

admins.each do |login|
  # This causes a round-trip to the server for each admin in the data bag
  admin = data_bag_item('admins', login)
  homedir = '/home/#{login}'

  # for each admin in the data bag, make a user resource
  # to ensure they exist
  user(login) do
    uid admin['uid']
    gid admin['gid']
    shell admin['shell']
    comment admin['comment']
    home homedir
    manage_home true
  end
end

# Create an "admins" group on the system
# You might use this group in the /etc/sudoers file
# to provide sudo access to the admins
group 'admins' do
  gid '999'
  members 'admins'
end
```
