The following recipe is added to the run-list for every node on which a
list of cookbooks and versions will be generated as report output after
every Chef Infra Client run.

```ruby
include_recipe 'chef_handler'

cookbook_file "#{node['chef_handler']['handler_path']}/cookbook_versions.rb" do
  source 'cookbook_versions.rb'
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  action :create
end

chef_handler 'Opscode::CookbookVersionsHandler' do
  source "#{node['chef_handler']['handler_path']}/cookbook_versions.rb"
  supports :report => true
  action :enable
end
```

This recipe will generate report output similar to the following:

```ruby
