When searching, an environment is an attribute. This allows search
results to be limited to a specified environment by using Boolean
operators and extra search terms. For example, to use knife to search
for all of the servers running CentOS in an environment named "QA",
enter the following:

```bash
knife search node "chef_environment:QA AND platform:centos"
```

Or, to include the same search in a recipe, use a code block similar to:

```ruby
qa_nodes = search(:node, 'chef_environment:QA')
qa_nodes.each do |qa_node|
    # Do useful work specific to qa nodes only
end
```
