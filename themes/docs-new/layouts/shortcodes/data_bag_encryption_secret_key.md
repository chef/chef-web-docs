Encrypting a data bag item requires a secret key. A secret key can be
created in any number of ways. For example, OpenSSL can be used to
generate a random number, which can then be used as the secret key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\r\n' > encrypted_data_bag_secret
```

where `encrypted_data_bag_secret` is the name of the file which will
contain the secret key. For example, to create a secret key named
"my_secret_key":

```bash
openssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\r\n' > my_secret_key
```

The `tr` command eliminates any trailing line feeds. Doing so avoids key
corruption when transferring the file between platforms with different
line endings.
