If the `config.json` file specifies the following cookbooks are
published to a GitHub repository:

```javascript
"delivery-truck":{
  "publish": {
    "github": "chef/chef-web-docs"
  }
}
```

where `"chef/chef-web-docs"` represents the organization/repository to
which the `build-cookbook` belongs.

This publishing option requires the `github` deploy key for that
repository to be available from a data bag on the Chef Infra Server that
is part of this Chef Automate configuration.
