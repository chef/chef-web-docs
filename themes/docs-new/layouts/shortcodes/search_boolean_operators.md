An operator can be used to ensure that certain terms are included in the
results, are excluded from the results, or are not included even when
other aspects of the query match. Searches can use the following
operators:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 40%" />
<col style="width: 60%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>AND</code></td>
<td>Use to find a match when both terms exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>OR</code></td>
<td>Use to find a match if either term exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>NOT</code></td>
<td>Use to exclude the term after <code>NOT</code> from the search results.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
