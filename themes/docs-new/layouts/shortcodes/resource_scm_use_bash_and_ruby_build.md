The following example shows how Bash can be used to install a plug-in
for rbenv named `ruby-build`, which is located in git version source
control. First, the application is synchronized, and then Bash changes
its working directory to the location in which `ruby-build` is located,
and then runs a command.

```ruby
git "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-build" do
  repository 'git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git'
  revision 'master'
  action :sync
end

bash 'install_ruby_build' do
  cwd "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-build"
  user 'rbenv'
  group 'rbenv'
  code <<-EOH
    ./install.sh
    EOH
  environment 'PREFIX' => '/usr/local'
end
```
