When the chef-repo is cloned from GitHub, the following occurs:

-   A directory named `data_bags` is created.
-   For each data bag, a sub-directory is created that has the same name
    as the data bag.
-   For each data bag item, a JSON file is created and placed in the
    appropriate sub-directory.

The `data_bags` directory can be placed under version source control.

When deploying from a private repository using a data bag, use the
`deploy_key` option to ensure the private key is present:

```ruby
{
  'id': 'my_app',
  ... (truncated) ...
  'deploy_key': 'ssh_private_key'
}
```

where `ssh_private_key` is the same SSH private key as used with a
private git repository and the new lines converted to `\n`.
