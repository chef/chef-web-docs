Chef Infra Client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is
under management by Chef Infra Server. When Chef Infra Client runs,
it performs all of the steps required for bringing a node into the expected
state, including:

- Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server
- Building the node object
- Synchronizing cookbooks from the Chef Infra Server to the node
- Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
- Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
- Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required
