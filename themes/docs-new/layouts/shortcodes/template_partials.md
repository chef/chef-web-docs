A template can be built in a way that allows it to contain references to
one (or more) smaller template files. (These smaller template files are
also referred to as partials.) A partial can be referenced from a
template file in one of the following ways:

-   By using the `render` method in the template file
-   By using the **template** resource and the `variables` property.
