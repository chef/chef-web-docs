To initialize a project using a Bitbucket repository, run a command
similar to:

```bash
delivery init --bitbucket PROJECT_KEY -r REPO_NAME
```

where `PROJECT_KEY` is the name of the project key in Bitbucket and
`REPO_NAME` is the name of the repository in Bitbucket. For example to
initialize the `anagrams` repository in Bitbucket with the `TEST`
project key:

```bash
delivery init --bitbucket TEST -r anagrams
```

and returns output similar to:

```none
