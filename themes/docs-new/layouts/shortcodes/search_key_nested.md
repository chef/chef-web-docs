A nested field appears deeper in the JSON data structure. For example,
information about a network interface might be several layers deep:
`node['network']['interfaces']['en1']`. When nested fields are present
in a JSON structure, Chef Infra Client will extract those nested fields
to the top-level, flattening them into compound fields that support
wildcard search patterns.

By combining wildcards with range-matching patterns and wildcard
queries, it is possible to perform very powerful searches, such as using
the vendor part of the MAC address to find every node that has a network
card made by the specified vendor.

Consider the following snippet of JSON data:

```javascript
{"network":
  [
  //snipped...
    "interfaces",
      {"en1": {
        "number": "1",
        "flags": [
          "UP",
          "BROADCAST",
          "SMART",
          "RUNNING",
          "SIMPLEX",
          "MULTICAST"
        ],
        "addresses": {
          "fe80::fa1e:dfff:fed8:63a2": {
            "scope": "Link",
            "prefixlen": "64",
            "family": "inet6"
          },
          "f8:1e:df:d8:63:a2": {
            "family": "lladdr"
          },
          "192.0.2.0": {
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
            "broadcast": "192.168.0.255",
            "family": "inet"
          }
        },
        "mtu": "1500",
        "media": {
          "supported": {
            "autoselect": {
              "options": [

              ]
            }
          },
          "selected": {
            "autoselect": {
              "options": [

              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "type": "en",
        "status": "active",
        "encapsulation": "Ethernet"
      },
  //snipped...
```

Before this data is indexed on the Chef Infra Server, the nested fields
are extracted into the top level, similar to:

```none
"broadcast" => "192.168.0.255",
"flags"     => ["UP", "BROADCAST", "SMART", "RUNNING", "SIMPLEX", "MULTICAST"]
"mtu"       => "1500"
```

which allows searches like the following to find data that is present in
this node:

```ruby
node "broadcast:192.168.0.*"
```

or:

```ruby
node "mtu:1500"
```

or:

```ruby
node "flags:UP"
```

This data is also flattened into various compound fields, which follow
the same pattern as the JSON hierarchy and use underscores (`_`) to
separate the levels of data, similar to:

```none
# ...snip...
"network_interfaces_en1_addresses_192.0.2.0_broadcast" => "192.168.0.255",
"network_interfaces_en1_addresses_fe80::fa1e:tldr_family"  => "inet6",
"network_interfaces_en1_addresses"                         => ["fe80::fa1e:tldr","f8:1e:df:tldr","192.0.2.0"]
# ...snip...
```

which allows searches like the following to find data that is present in
this node:

```ruby
node "network_interfaces_en1_addresses:192.0.2.0"
```

This flattened data structure also supports using wildcard compound
fields, which allow searches to omit levels within the JSON data
structure that are not important to the search query. In the following
example, an asterisk (`*`) is used to show where the wildcard can exist
when searching for a nested field:

```ruby
"network_interfaces_*_flags"     => ["UP", "BROADCAST", "SMART", "RUNNING", "SIMPLEX", "MULTICAST"]
"network_interfaces_*_addresses" => ["fe80::fa1e:dfff:fed8:63a2", "192.0.2.0", "f8:1e:df:d8:63:a2"]
"network_interfaces_en0_media_*" => ["autoselect", "none", "1000baseT", "10baseT/UTP", "100baseTX"]
"network_interfaces_en1_*"       => ["1", "UP", "BROADCAST", "SMART", "RUNNING", "SIMPLEX", "MULTICAST",
                                     "fe80::fa1e:dfff:fed8:63a2", "f8:1e:df:d8:63:a2", "192.0.2.0",
                                     "1500", "supported", "selected", "en", "active", "Ethernet"]
```

For each of the wildcard examples above, the possible values are shown
contained within the brackets. When running a search query, the query
syntax for wildcards is to simply omit the name of the node (while
preserving the underscores), similar to:

```ruby
network_interfaces__flags
```

This query will search within the `flags` node, within the JSON
structure, for each of `UP`, `BROADCAST`, `SMART`, `RUNNING`, `SIMPLEX`,
and `MULTICAST`.
