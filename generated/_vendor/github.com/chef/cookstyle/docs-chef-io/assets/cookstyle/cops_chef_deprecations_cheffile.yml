description: The Librarian-Chef depsolving project is no longer maintained and a Cheffile
  should not be used for cookbook depsolving. Consider using Policyfiles instead.
  If the Policyfiles model is not compatible with your workflow you may find Berkshelf
  offers a more similar, and still supported, experience to Librarian-Chef.
