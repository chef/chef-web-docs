description: |-
  The Ohai default recipe previously allowed a user to ship custom Ohai plugins to a system by including them
  in a directory in the Ohai cookbook. This functionality was replaced with the ohai_plugin resource, which
  should be used instead as it doesn't require forking the ohai cookbook.
