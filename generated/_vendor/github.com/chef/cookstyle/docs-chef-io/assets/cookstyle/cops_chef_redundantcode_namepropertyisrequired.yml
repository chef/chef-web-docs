  When using properties in a custom resource you shouldn't set a property to
  be both required and a name_property. Name properties are a way to optionally
  override the name given to the resource block in cookbook code. In your resource
  code you use the name_property and if the user doesn't pass in anything to that
  property its value will be populated with resource block's name. This
  allows users to provide more friendly resource names for logging that give
  additional context on the change being made.

  How about a nice example! Here we have a resource called ntp_config that has a
  name_property of config_file. All throughout the code of this resource we'd
  use new_resource.config_file when referencing the path to the config.

  We can use a friendly name for the block and specific a value to config_file
  ntp_config 'Configure the main config file' do
    config_file '/etc/ntp/ntp.conf'
    action :create
  end

  We can also just set the config path as the resource block and Chef will
  make sure to pass this in as new_resource.config_file as well.
  ntp_config '/etc/ntp/ntp.conf' do
    action :create
  end

  The core tenant of the name property feature is that these properties are optional
  and making them required effectively turns off the functionality provided by name
  properties. If the goal is to always require the user to pass the config_file property
  then it should just be made a required property and not a name_property.
