description: Chef Infra Client 15.3 and later include a new Unified Mode that simplifies
  the execution of resources by replace the traditional compile and converge phases
  with a single phase. Unified mode simplifies writing advanced resources and avoids
  confusing errors that often occur when mixing ruby and Chef Infra resources. Chef
  Infra Client 17.0 and later will begin warning that `unified_mode true` should be
  set in all resources to validate that they will continue to function in Chef Infra
  Client 18.0 (April 2022) when Unified Mode becomes the default.
