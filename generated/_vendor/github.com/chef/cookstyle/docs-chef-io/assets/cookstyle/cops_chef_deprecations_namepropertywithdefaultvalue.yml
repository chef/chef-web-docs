description: A resource property (or attribute) can't be marked as a name_property
  (or name_attribute) and also have a default value. The name property is a special
  property that is derived from the name of the resource block in and thus always
  has a value passed to the resource. For example if you define `my_resource 'foo'`
  in recipe, then the name property of `my_resource` will automatically be set to
  `foo`. Setting a property to be both a name_property and have a default value will
  cause Chef Infra Client failures in 13.0 and later releases.
