description: Starting with Chef Infra Client 16, using `resource_name` without also
  using `provides` will result in resource failures. Make sure to use both `resource_name`
  and `provides` to change the name of the resource. You can also omit `resource_name`
  entirely if the value set matches the name Chef Infra Client automatically assigns
  based on COOKBOOKNAME_FILENAME.
