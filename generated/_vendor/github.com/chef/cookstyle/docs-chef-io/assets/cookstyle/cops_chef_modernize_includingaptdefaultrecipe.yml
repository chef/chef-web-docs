description: For many users the apt::default cookbook is used only to update apt's
  package cache. Chef Infra Client 12.7 and later include an apt_update resource which
  should be used to perform this instead. Keep in mind that some users will want to
  stick with the apt::default recipe as it also installs packages necessary for using
  https repositories on Debian systems and manages some configuration files.
