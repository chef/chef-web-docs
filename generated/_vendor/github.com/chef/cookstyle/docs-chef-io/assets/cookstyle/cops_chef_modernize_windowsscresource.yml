  of windows services on legacy Chef Infra Client releases. Chef Infra Client 14.0
  and later includes :create, :delete, and :configure actions without the need for
  additional cookbook dependencies. See the windows_service documentation at https://docs.chef.io/resources/windows_service
  for additional details on creating services with the windows_service resource.
