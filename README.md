# chef-web-docs

This repo is the source of the Chef reference documentation located at
https://docs.chef.io/

## Workstation Documentation

The Chef Workstation documentation is stored in the `chef/chef-workstation` repository
in the [`www`](https://github.com/chef/chef-workstation/tree/master/www) directory.
We use [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) to build the [Chef Workstation documentation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/).

### Preview local changes to chef-workstation documentation from chef-web-docs

Follow these steps to preview changes to the chef-workstation documentation while
running Hugo from chef-web-docs.

1. Clone `chef/chef-web-docs` and `chef/chef-workstation` into the same directory.

1. Modify the go.mod file in `chef-web-docs`.

   Add `replace github.com/chef/chef-workstation/www => ../chef-workstation/www` below the
   `require` statement. The whole file should look like this:

   ```
   module github.com/chef/chef-web-docs

   go 1.14

   require github.com/chef/chef-workstation/www v0.0.0-<commit timestamp>-<commit SHA> // indirect

   replace github.com/chef/chef-workstation/www => ../chef-workstation/www
   ```

1. Start the Hugo server from `chef-web-docs`:

   ```
   make serve
   ```

You can preview any changes made to the documentation in `chef-workstation` as
they would appear on https://docs.chef.io.

**Before you submit a PR**

- Delete or comment out the `replace` directive in the chef-web-docs/go.mod file.

## The fastest way to contribute

The fastest way to change the documentation is to edit a page on the
GitHub website using the GitHub UI.

To perform edits using the GitHub UI, click on the `[edit on GitHub]` link at
the top of the page that you want to edit. The link takes you to that topic's GitHub
page. In GitHub, click on the pencil icon and make your changes. You can preview
how they'll look right on the page ("Preview Changes" tab).

We also require contributors to include their [DCO signoff](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certification-of-origin-dco)
in the comment section of every pull request, except for obvious fixes. You can
add your DCO signoff to the comments by including `Signed-off-by:`, followed by
your name and email address, like this:

`Signed-off-by: Julia Child <juliachild@chef.io>`

See our [blog post](https://blog.chef.io/introducing-developer-certificate-of-origin/)
for more information about the DCO and why we require it.

After you've added your DCO signoff, add a comment about your proposed change,
then click on the "Propose file change" button at the bottom of the page and
confirm your pull request. The CI system will do some checks and add a comment
to your PR with the results.

The Chef docs team can normally merge pull requests within seven days. We'll
fix build errors before we merge, so you don't have to
worry about passing all of the CI checks, but it might add an extra
few days. The important part is submitting your change.

## Local Development Environment

The Chef Documentation website is built using:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 0.61 or higher
- [Node](https://www.nodejs.com) 10.0.0 or higher
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) 5.6.0 or higher
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.12 or higher

To install Hugo, NPM, and Go on Windows and macOS:

- On macOS run: `brew install hugo node go`
- On Windows run: `choco install hugo nodejs golang`

To install Hugo on Linux, run:

- `apt install -y build-essential`
- `snap install node --classic --channel=12`
- `snap install hugo --channel=extended`

To build the docs and preview locally:

- Run `make serve`
- go to http://localhost:1313

To clean your local development environment:

- Running `make clean` will delete the sass files, javascript, and fonts. These will
	be rebuilt the next time you run `make serve`.

- Running `make clean_all` will delete the node modules used to build this site
	in addition to the functions of `make clean` described above. Those node
	modules will be reinstalled the next time you run `make serve`.

Hugo uses [Goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) which is a
superset of Markdown that includes GitHub styled tables, task lists, and
definition lists.

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes are simple snippets of code that can be used to modify a Markdown
page by adding content or changing the appearance of content in a page. See
Hugo's [shortcode documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)
for general information about shortcodes.

We primarily use shortcodes in two ways:

- adding reusable text
- highlighting blocks of text in notes or warnings to warn users or
provide additional important information

### Adding reusable text

There are often cases where we want to maintain blocks of text that are identical
from one page to the next. In those cases, we add that text, formatted in Markdown,
to a shortcode file located in `chef-web-docs/layouts/shortcodes`.

To add that shortcode to a page in `chef-web-docs/content`, add the file name,
minus the .md suffix, wrapped in double curly braces and percent symbols to
the location in the Markdown page where you want that text included. For example,
if you want to add the text in `shortcode_file_name.md` to a page, add
`{{% shortcode_file_name %}}` to the text of that page and it will appear when
Hugo rebuilds the documentation.

**Shortcodes in lists**

Hugo doesn't handle shortcodes that are indented in a list item properly. It interprets
the text of the shortcode as a code block. More complicated shortcodes with
code blocks, notes, additional list items, or other formatting look pretty
bad. We've created a simple shortcode for handling shortcodes in lists or definition
lists called `shortcode_indent`.

To include a shortcode in a list or definition list, just add its file name
to the `shortcode` parameter of `shortcode_indent` without the .md suffix.

For example, if you wanted to add `shortcode_file_name.md` to a list:
``` md
1.  Here is some text introducing the shortcode, but it's not necessary.

    {{< shortcode_indent shortcode="shortcode_file_name" >}}
```

### Highlighting blocks of text

We also use shortcodes to highlight text in notes, warnings or danger notices.
These should be used sparingly especially danger notices or warnings. Wrap text
that you want in a note using opening and closing shortcode notation. For example,

```
{{< note >}}

Note text that gives the user additional important information.

{{< /note >}}
```

To add a warning or danger, replace the word `note` with `warning` or `danger` in the
example above.

**Notes in lists**

Hugo doesn't handle shortcodes that are indented in lists very well, that includes the Note,
Warning, and Danger shortcodes. It interprets the indented text that's inside
the Note as a code block when it should be interpreted as Markdown.

To resolve this problem, there's a `spaces` parameter that can be added to the Note,
Warning, and Danger shortcodes. The value of spaces should be set to the number
of spaces that the note is indented.

For example:
```
This is a list:

-   List item.

    {{< note spaces=4 >}}

    Text that gives the user additional important information about that list item.

    {{< /note >}}
```

This parameter also works on Danger and Warning shortcodes.

## Sending feedback

We love getting feedback. You can use:

- Email --- Send an email to docs@chef.io for documentation bugs,
  ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. This email address is not a
  support email address, however. If you need support, contact Chef
  support.
- Pull request --- Submit a PR to this repo using either of the two
  methods described above.
- GitHub issues --- Use the https://github.com/chef/chef/issues page
  for issues specific to Chef Infra itself. This is a good place for
  "important" documentation bugs that may need visibility among a
  larger group, especially in situations where a doc bug may also
  surface a product bug. You can also use
  [chef-web-docs issues](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/issues),
  especially for docs feature requests and minor docs bugs.
- https://discourse.chef.io/ --- This is a great place to interact with Chef and others.

## Documentation snapshots

The previous scoped doc sets that were found off of https://docs.chef.io/release/ are no longer available in this repo. Instead,
those doc sets are located at https://docs-archive.chef.io/. The index page on the docs archive site provides links to them. The doc sets retain their unique
left nav and can be used to view content at a particular point in time for a given release. In the future, snapshots
will be added for major releases of products/projects or for products/projects/components that are no longer supported.

## Archive of pre-2016 commit history
