All knife subcommands have the following syntax:

   knife subcommand [ARGUMENT] (options)

Each subcommand has its own set of arguments and options.

.. note:: All syntax examples in this document show variables in ALL_CAPS. For example ``-u PORT_LIST`` (where PORT_LIST is a comma-separated list of local and public UDP ports) or ``-F FORMAT`` (where FORMAT determines the output format, either ``summary``, ``text``, ``json``, ``yaml``, or ``pp``). These variables often require specific values that are unique to each organization.
