windows_service
=====================================================

.. tag resource_service_windows

Use the **windows_service** resource to manage a service on the Microsoft Windows platform.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
A **windows_service** resource block manages the state of a service on a machine that is running Microsoft Windows. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'BITS' do
     action :configure_startup
     startup_type :manual
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **windows_service** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'name' do
     init_command               String
     notifies                   # see description
     pattern                    String
     provider                   Chef::Provider::Service::Windows
     reload_command             String
     restart_command            String
     service_name               String # defaults to 'name' if not specified
     start_command              String
     startup_type               Symbol
     status_command             String
     stop_command               String
     subscribes                 # see description
     supports                   Hash
     timeout                    Integer
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :nothing if not specified
   end

   Configure a service based on the value of the ``startup_type`` property.

``:disable``
   Disable a service. This action is equivalent to a ``Disabled`` startup type on the Microsoft Windows platform.

``:enable``
   Enable a service at boot. This action is equivalent to an ``Automatic`` startup type on the Microsoft Windows platform.

``:nothing``
   Default. Do nothing with a service.

   Reload the configuration for this service.

``:restart``
   Restart a service.

``:start``
   Start a service, and keep it running until stopped or disabled.

``:stop``
   Stop a service.

.. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``init_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The path to the init script that is associated with the service. This is typically ``/etc/init.d/SERVICE_NAME``.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag 5_3

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``pattern``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The pattern to look for in the process table. Default value: ``service_name``.

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.

``reload_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to tell a service to reload its configuration.

``restart_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to restart a service.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``service_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The name of the service. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``start_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to start a service.

``startup_type``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   Use to specify the startup type for a Microsoft Windows service. Possible values: ``:automatic``, ``:disabled``, or ``:manual``. Default value: ``:automatic``.

``status_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to check the run status for a service.

``stop_command``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The command used to stop a service.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag 5_3

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``supports``
   **Ruby Type:** Hash

   A list of properties that controls how the chef-client is to attempt to manage a service: ``:restart``, ``:reload``, ``:status``. For ``:restart``, the init script or other service provider can use a restart command; if ``:restart`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to stop and then start a service. For ``:reload``, the init script or other service provider can use a reload command. For ``:status``, the init script or other service provider can use a status command to determine if the service is running; if ``:status`` is not specified, the chef-client attempts to match the ``service_name`` against the process table as a regular expression, unless a pattern is specified as a parameter property. Default value: ``{ :restart => false, :reload => false, :status => false }`` for all platforms (except for the Red Hat platform family, which defaults to ``{ :restart => false, :reload => false, :status => true }``.)

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   Microsoft Windows platform only. The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out. Default value: ``60``.

Providers
=====================================================
.. tag resources_common_provider

Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_provider_attributes

The chef-client will determine the correct provider based on configuration data collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run. This configuration data is then mapped to a platform and an associated list of providers.

Generally, it's best to let the chef-client choose the provider, and this is (by far) the most common approach. However, in some cases, specifying a provider may be desirable. There are two approaches:

* Use a more specific short name---``yum_package "foo" do`` instead of ``package "foo" do``, ``script "foo" do`` instead of ``bash "foo" do``, and so on---when available
* Use the ``provider`` property within the resource block to specify the long name of the provider as a property of a resource. For example: ``provider Chef::Provider::Long::Name``

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_service_windows_providers

The **windows_service** resource does not have service-specific short names. This is because the chef-client identifies the platform at the start of every chef-client run based on data collected by Ohai. The chef-client looks up the platform, and then determines the correct provider for that platform. In certain situations, such as when more than one init system is available on a node, a specific provider may need to be identified by using the ``provider`` attribute and the long name for that provider.

This resource has the following providers:

``Chef::Provider::Service::Windows``, ``windows_service``
   The provider that is used with the Microsoft Windows platform.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Start a service manually**

.. tag resource_service_windows_manual_start

.. To install a package:

.. code-block:: ruby

   windows_service 'BITS' do
     action :configure_startup
     startup_type :manual
   end

.. end_tag
