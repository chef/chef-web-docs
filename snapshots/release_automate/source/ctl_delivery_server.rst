.. tag ctl_delivery_server_1

The Chef Automate server includes a command-line utility named delivery-ctl. Use this command-line tool to:

* Manage enterprises, users, and projects
* Reconfigure the Chef Automate server
* Start and stop individual services
* Tail Chef Automate server log files

.. note:: All commands must be run as ``sudo``.

.. end_tag

.. _ctl_delivery_server-cleanse:

cleanse
=====================================================
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_cleanse

The ``cleanse`` subcommand is used to re-set the Chef Automate server to the state it was in prior to the first time the ``reconfigure`` subcommand is run. This command will:

* Destroy all data and logs
* Create a backup of the system config files and place them in a directory in root, such as ``/root/delivery-cleanse-2015-12-15T15:51``

The software that was put on-disk by the package installation will remain. Re-run ``delivery-ctl reconfigure`` to recreate the default data and configuration files.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl cleanse

.. end_tag

.. _ctl_delivery_server-create-backup:

create-backup
=====================================================
The ``create-backup`` subcommand is used to create Chef Automate backup archives and Elasticseach snapshots. When used with the default configuration it will create backup archives and Elasticseach snapshots and export them into the ``/var/opt/delivery/backups`` and ``/var/opt/delivery/elasticsearch_backups`` directories.

The storage location of the backup archives and snapshots can be configured by setting ``backup['location']`` and ``backup['elasticsearch']['location']`` in ``delivery.rb``.

.. note:: Under normal operating circumstances the Chef Automate RabbitMQ queues are not likely to be lengthy. When factoring that fact with the requirement of shutting down Chef Automate services in order to take a backup of RabbitMQ, it was determined that it was not ideal to include RabbitMQ data by default.

**Backing up to S3**

While not enabled by default, the utility supports backing up Chef Automate archives and snapshots directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.

To enable this functionality, first configure the machine with access to the desired S3 bucket using either an instance profile with a valid S3 policy or a standard shared credential file located at ``/root/.aws/credentials``.

Below is an example Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance profile policy with the required permissions:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Action": [
           "s3:CreateBucket",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetBucketLocation",
           "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
           "s3:ListBucketVersions"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::example-backups"
         ]
       },
       {
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:DeleteObject",
           "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
           "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::example-backups/\*"
         ]
       }
     ],
     "Version": "2012-10-17"
   }

Next, configure Chef Automate to use S3. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   backup['bucket']                    = 'example-backups'
   backup['region']                    = 'us-west-2'
   backup['type']                      = 's3'
   backup['elasticsearch']['bucket']   = 'example-backups'
   backup['elasticsearch']['region']   = 'us-west-2'
   backup['elasticsearch']['type']     = 's3'

.. note:: Using the same bucket for backup archives and snapshots is supported but both must be configured independently.

See the complete list of Chef Automate :doc:`configuration options </config_rb_delivery_optional_settings>` for additional backup configuration.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl create-backup [NAME] [options]
        --chef-server-config         Backup up the Chef Server config if present

        --no-wait                    Do not wait for non-blocking backup operations
        --quiet                      Do not output non-error information
        --rabbit                     Back up Chef Automate's RabbitMQ queues

    -h, --help                       Show the usage message

.. note:: The ``ELASTICSEARCH_SNAPSHOT`` value is optional when given a backup archive path.

**Examples**

Complete restoration of a local backup archive and shared filesystem Elasticsearch snapshot:

  1. Copy the Chef Automate backup archive to a directory that is large enough to expand the the archive, e.g.:
       ``scp user@backup-server:2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup.zst /mnt/ephemeral/``
  2. Install the same version of Chef Automate that was used to take the backup. If the versions do not match you be prompted with a compatibility warning but can still proceed with the restore if you choose to do so.
       ``dpkg -i delivery.rpm``
  3. Mount the Elasticsearch shared filesystem to the same mount point.
       ``mount backup-server:/export/chef-automate/elasticsearch_backups /var/opt/delivery/elasticsearch_backups``
  4. Restore the backup archive and snapshot:
       ``$ delivery-ctl restore-backup /mnt/ephemeral/2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup.zst 2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup --staging-dir /mnt/ephemeral/restore``

.. note:: Specifying a staging directory is not mandatatory but when given it will clear **all** existing data from it.

Complete restoration with a backup archive and Elasticsearch snapshot in S3:

  1. Install the same version of Chef Automate that was used to take the backup. If the versions do not match you can still proceed with the restore but we cannot guarantee compatibility.
       ``dpkg -i delivery.rpm``
  2. Restore the backup archive and snapshot:
       ``$ delivery-ctl restore-backup us-east-1:your-s3-bucket:2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup.zst 2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup``

Restore only an Elasticsearch snapshot:

  1. Determine the snapshot you want to restore
       ``delivery-ctl list-backups --elasticsearch``
  2. Restore it
       ``delivery-ctl restore-backup 2016-10-14-08-38-55-chef-automate-backup``

Restore only database and git repositories from an archive in S3:

  1. Determine the archive you want to restore
       ``delivery-ctl list-backups --automate``
  2. Restore it

.. tag ctl_delivery_server_start

The ``start`` subcommand is used to start all services that are enabled in the Chef Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl start name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully started the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s

The supervisor for the Chef Automate server is configured to wait seven seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If you see output that references a timeout, it means that a signal has been sent to the process, but that the process has yet to actually comply. In general, processes that have timed out are not a big concern, unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all. If a process is not responding, use a command like the ``kill`` subcommand to stop the process, investigate the cause (if required), and then use the ``start`` subcommand to re-enable it.

status
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_status

The ``status`` subcommand is used to show the status of all services available to the Chef Automate server. The results will vary based on the configuration of a given server. This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl status

and will return the status for all services. Status can be returned for individual services by specifying the name of the service as part of the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl status name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

When service status is requested, the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ run: service_name: (pid 12345) 12345s; run: log: (pid 1234) 67890s

where

* ``run:`` is the state of the service (``run:`` or ``down:``)
* ``service_name:`` is the name of the service for which status is returned
* ``(pid 12345)`` is the process identifier
* ``12345s`` is the uptime of the service, in seconds

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ down: opscode-erchef: (pid 35546) 10s

By default, runit will restart services automatically when the services fail. Therefore, runit may report the status of a service as ``run:`` even when there is an issue with that service. When investigating why a particular service is not running as it should be, look for the services with the shortest uptimes. For example, the list below indicates that the **opscode-erchef** should be investigated further:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: oc-id
   run: opscode-chef: (pid 4327) 13671s; run: log: (pid 4326) 13671s
   run: opscode-erchef: (pid 5383) 5s; run: log: (pid 4382) 13669s
   run: opscode-expander: (pid 4078) 13694s; run: log: (pid 4077) 13694s
   run: opscode-expander-reindexer: (pid 4130) 13692s; run: log: (pid 4114) 13692s

.. end_tag

Log Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_status_logs

A typical status line for a service that is running any of the Chef Automate server front-end services is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s

where:

* ``run`` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep processes. This state is either ``run`` or ``down``. If a service is in a ``down`` state, it should be stopped
* ``name_of_service`` is the service name, for example: ``opscode-solr4``
* ``(pid 1486) 7819s;`` is the process identifier followed by the amount of time (in seconds) the service has been running
* ``run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s`` is the log process. It is typical for a log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   down: opscode-solr4: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s

where

* ``down`` indicates that the service is in a down state
* ``3s, normally up;`` indicates that the service is normally in a run state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service after a reboot

.. end_tag

stop
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_stop

The ``stop`` subcommand is used to stop all services enabled on the Chef Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl stop name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully stopped the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: diwb: service_name: 0s, normally up

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl stop

will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   ok: down: nginx: 393s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-chef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-erchef: 391s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander: 390s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-expander-reindexer: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: opscode-solr4: 389s, normally up
   ok: down: postgresql: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: rabbitmq: 388s, normally up
   ok: down: redis_lb: 387s, normally up

.. end_tag

tail
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_tail

The ``tail`` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef Automate server logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl tail name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.

.. end_tag

term
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag ctl_delivery_server_term

The ``term`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGTERM`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl term name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.
