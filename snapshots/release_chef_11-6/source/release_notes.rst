Release Notes: chef-client 11.6
=====================================================

.. tag chef

Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Whether youâ€™re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.

This diagram shows how you develop, test, and deploy your Chef code.

Known Issues
=====================================================
The following issues are known for chef-client 11.6 and/or may affect the behavior of your current environment if you upgrade to chef-client 11.6:

* `CHEF-4406 <http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4406>`_  --- response_file fails trying to load preseed templates and falls back to cookbook files
* `CHEF-4419 <http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4419>`_  --- Absolute file paths with no drive letter for file resources on Windows fails chef-client run
* `CHEF-4422 <http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4422>`_  --- remote_file fails when source becomes too long
* `CHEF-4435 <http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4435>`_  --- Chef::DataBag.save does a PUT getting a 405 from the chef server; as a result of changes to the Chef server API, a chef-client must be version 11.6 (or higher) when using the ``knife data bag from file`` argument with the Enterprise Chef or Open Source Chef version 11 servers.

What's New
=====================================================
The following items are new for chef-client 11.6 and/or are changes from previous versions. The short version:

* **Support for SELinux** Support for SELinux has been improved, including the chef-client using the ``restorecon`` command when using **file**-based resources, correctly matching default policy settings (when the underlying cookbook also conforms to the same policy settings), and configurable file permission fixup (with the ``enable_selinux_file_permission_fixup`` setting in the client.rb file).
* **Atomic file updates** Atomic file updates ensure that updates are still made in certain situations, such as if disk space runs out or when a binary is being updated.
* **Lazy attribute evaluation** In some cases, the value for an attribute cannot be known until the execute phase of a chef-client run. Instead of an attribute being assigned a value, it may instead be assigned a code block, which can then be used during the execute phase to determine the attribute value.
* **Rebuilt file resource** The **file** resource has been refactored and is now the base resource for the **cookbook_file**, **remote_file**, and **template** resources.
* **New common attributes for file-based resources** The ``atomic_update``, ``force_unlink``, and ``manage_symlink_source`` attributes have been added.
* **New attributes for remote_file resource** The ``ftp_active_mode``, ``headers``, ``use_conditional_get``, ``use_etag``, and ``use_last_modified`` have been added.
* **New helper methods for the template resource** The ``helper`` and ``helpers`` attributes have been added. Use these to define helper methods to extend templates using by using inline helper methods, inline helper modules, and cookbook library modules.
* **Updated attributes for file-based resources** The ``source`` attribute has been modified to support FTP and local files.
* **Updated behavior for the mode attribute** The ``mode`` attribute default behavior is changed for file-based resources and the **directory** resource.
* **New batch resource** Execute a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter. A temporary file is created and then executed like other script resources.
* **New powershell_script resource** Execute a script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter just like the **script** resource, but designed for the Microsoft Windows platform and the Windows PowerShell interpreter.
* **New settings for the client.rb file** The ``data_bag_decrypt_minimum_version``, ``enable_selinux_file_permission_fixup``, and ``file_atomic_update`` settings have been added.
* **New subcommands for Knife** ``knife deps``, ``knife edit``, and ``knife xargs`` have been added.
* **New options for Knife subcommands** The ``knife delete``, ``knife diff``, ``knife download``, ``knife list``, and ``knife upload`` subcommands have new options.
* **Support for environments in chef-solo** chef-solo now supports environments.
* **New way to force a redeploy when using the deploy resource** To force a redeploy, delete either the deployment directory or the cache file.
* **Changed behavior for chef-shell** chef-shell behavior is changed to load recipes while in chef-client mode. This is by design and represents the behavior as originally intended.

Required Updates
-----------------------------------------------------
.. warning:: The following updates must also be made at the same time as any upgrade to chef-client 11.6.

* If the ``partial-search`` cookbook is being used, it must be upgraded to version 1.0.2 (or higher)
* If the ``sudo`` cookbook is being used, it must be upgraded to version 2.1.4 (or higher)

Atomic File Updates
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resources_common_atomic_update

Atomic updates are used with **file**-based resources to help ensure that file updates can be made when updating a binary or if disk space runs out.

Atomic updates are enabled by default. They can be managed globally using the ``file_atomic_update`` setting in the client.rb file. They can be managed on a per-resource basis using the ``atomic_update`` property that is available with the **cookbook_file**, **file**, **remote_file**, and **template** resources.

.. note:: On certain platforms, and after a file has been moved into place, the chef-client may modify file permissions to support features specific to those platforms. On platforms with SELinux enabled, the chef-client will fix up the security contexts after a file has been moved into the correct location by running the ``restorecon`` command. On the Microsoft Windows platform, the chef-client will create files so that ACL inheritance works as expected.

.. end_tag

Lazy Attribute Evaluation
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resources_common_lazy_evaluation

In some cases, the value for a property cannot be known until the execution phase of a chef-client run. In this situation, using lazy evaluation of property values can be helpful. Instead of a property being assigned a value, it may instead be assigned a code block. The syntax for using lazy evaluation is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   attribute_name lazy { code_block }

where ``lazy`` is used to tell the chef-client to evaluate the contents of the code block later on in the resource evaluation process (instead of immediately) and ``{ code_block }`` is arbitrary Ruby code that provides the value.

For example, a resource that is **not** doing lazy evaluation:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template 'template_name' do
     # some attributes
     path '/foo/bar'
   end

and a resource block that is doing lazy evaluation:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template 'template_name' do
     # some attributes
     path lazy { ' some Ruby code ' }
   end

In the previous examples, the first resource uses the value ``/foo/bar`` and the second resource uses the value provided by the code block, as long as the contents of that code block are a valid resource property.

The following example shows how to use lazy evaluation with template variables:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/tmp/canvey_island.txt' do
     source 'canvey_island.txt.erb'
     variables(
       lazy {
         { :canvey_island => node.run_state['sea_power'] }
       }
     )
   end

.. end_tag

**file**-based Resources
-----------------------------------------------------
Prior to chef-client 11.6, the chef-client relied on the underlying Ruby implementation to define behaviors for file-based resources (**cookbook_file**, **file**, **remote_file**, and **template**). These resources have been standardized and are now all fully based on the **file** resource.

* File-based providers now create all files with the same default permissions. This default is determined by operating system, file system type, and umask settings.
* When an SSH configuration file is created using the **cookbook_file** or **template** resources and the file mode for that SSH configuration file is not specified, it is possible for incorrect permissions to be applied. In previous versions, the chef-client would attempt to create the file with ``0600`` permissions if the file mode was not specified. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook_file "/home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys" do
        owner "bob"
        group "bob"
      end

   In chef-client 11.6, the chef-client may create files with other permissions---such as ``0644``---when the file mode is not specified. This may create situations where the correct permissions for an SSH configuration file are not applied, and subsequent SSH operations could fail. Use the ``mode`` attribute to ensure the correct permissions are applied to a file. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      cookbook_file "/home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys" do
        owner "bob"
        group "bob"
        mode 0600
      end

* File-based providers now have a defined behavior for when they encounter something other than a file when attempting to update a file. The ``force_unlink`` attribute is used to trigger an error (default) or to overwrite the target with the specified file. See the attributes section (below) for more information about this attribute.
* Many methods that were present in the file-based providers prior to chef-client 11.6 have been deprecated. If a custom provider has been authored that subclasses the pre-chef-client 11.6 file-based providers, the behavior of that custom provider should be re-tested after upgrading to chef-client 11.6 to verify all of the desired behaviors.

.. warning:: For a machine on which SELinux is enabled, the chef-client will create files that correctly match the default policy settings only when the cookbook that defines the action also conforms to the same policy.

File-based Attributes
-----------------------------------------------------
New attributes (common to all **file**-based resources):

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``atomic_update``
     - Perform atomic file updates on a per-resource basis. Set to ``true`` for atomic file updates. Set to ``false`` for non-atomic file updates. This setting overrides ``file_atomic_update``, which is a global setting found in the client.rb file.
   * - ``force_unlink``
     - How the chef-client handles certain situations when the target file turns out not to be a file. For example, when a target file is actually a symlink. Set to ``true`` for the chef-client delete the non-file target and replace it with the specified file. Set to ``false`` for the chef-client to raise an error.
   * - ``manage_symlink_source``
     - Cause the chef-client to detect and manage the source file for a symlink. Possible values: ``nil``, ``true``, or ``false``. When this value is set to ``nil``, the chef-client will manage a symlink's source file and emit a warning. When this value is set to ``true``, the chef-client will manage a symlink's source file and not emit a warning. Default value: ``nil``. The default value will be changed to ``false`` in a future version.

**remote_file** Attributes
-----------------------------------------------------
The **remote_file** resource was updated to be fully-based on the **file** resource. Updated attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``source``
     - Required. The location of the source file. Default value: ``nil``.

New attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``ftp_active_mode``
     - Whether the chef-client uses active or passive FTP. Set to ``true`` to use active FTP. Default value: ``false``.
   * - ``headers``
     - A Hash of custom headers. Default value: ``{}``.
   * - ``use_conditional_get``
     - Enable conditional HTTP requests by using a conditional ``GET`` (with the If-Modified-Since header) or an opaque identifier (ETag). To use If-Modified-Since headers, ``use_last_modified`` must also be set to ``true``. To use ETag headers, ``use_etag`` must also be set to ``true``. Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``use_etag``
     - Enable ETag headers. Set to ``false`` to disable ETag headers. To use this setting, ``use_conditional_get`` must also be set to ``true``. Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``use_last_modified``
     - Enable If-Modified-Since headers. Set to ``false`` to disable If-Modified-Since headers. To use this setting, ``use_conditional_get`` must also be set to ``true``. Default value: ``true``.

**template** Attributes
-----------------------------------------------------
The **template** resource was updated to be fully-based on the **file** resource. Updated attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``source``
     - The location of a template file. Can be used to distribute specific files to specific platforms. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block.

New attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``helper``
     - Define a helper method inline. For example: ``helper(:hello_world) { "hello world" }`` or ``helper(:app) { node["app"] }`` or ``helper(:app_conf) { |setting| node["app"][setting] }``. Default value: ``{}``.
   * - ``helpers``
     - Define a helper module inline or in a library. For example, an inline module: ``helpers do``, which is then followed by a block of Ruby code. And for a library module: ``helpers(MyHelperModule)``. Default value: ``[]``.

Helper Methods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_template_helper

A helper is a method or a module that can be used to extend a template. There are three approaches:

* An inline helper method
* An inline helper module
* A cookbook library module

Use the ``helper`` attribute in a recipe to define an inline helper method. Use the ``helpers`` attribute to define an inline helper module or a cookbook library module.

.. end_tag

**Inline Helper Methods**

.. tag resource_template_inline_method

A template helper method is always defined inline on a per-resource basis. A simple example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/path' do
     helper(:hello_world) { 'hello world' }
   end

Another way to define an inline helper method is to reference a node object so that repeated calls to one (or more) cookbook attributes can be done efficiently:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/path' do
     helper(:app) { node['app'] }
   end

An inline helper method can also take arguments:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/path' do
     helper(:app_conf) { |setting| node['app'][setting] }
   end

Once declared, a template can then use the helper methods to build a file. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Say hello: <%= hello_world %>

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   node['app']['listen_port'] is: <%= app['listen_port'] %>

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   node['app']['log_location'] is: <%= app_conf('log_location') %>

.. end_tag

**Inline Helper Modules**

.. tag resource_template_inline_module

A template helper module can be defined inline on a per-resource basis. This approach can be useful when a template requires more complex information. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/path' do
     helpers do

       def hello_world
         'hello world'
       end

       def app
         node['app']
       end

       def app_conf(setting)
         node['app']['setting']
       end

     end
   end

where the ``hello_world``, ``app``, and ``app_conf(setting)`` methods comprise the module that extends a template.

.. end_tag

**Cookbook Library Modules**

.. tag resource_template_library_module

A template helper module can be defined in a library. This is useful when extensions need to be reused across recipes or to make it easier to manage code that would otherwise be defined inline on a per-recipe basis.

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/path/to/template.erb' do
     helpers(MyHelperModule)
   end

.. end_tag

**cookbook_file** Attributes
-----------------------------------------------------
The **cookbook_file** resource was updated to be fully-based on the **file** resource. Updated attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``source``
     - The name of the file in ``COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default`` or the path to a file located in ``COOKBOOK_NAME/files``. The path must include the file name and its extension. Can be used to distribute specific files to specific platforms. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block.

Updated Behavior for mode Attribute
-----------------------------------------------------
The default behavior for the ``mode`` attribute has been updated. For the **directory** resource:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``mode``
     - If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'``, and then applies the umask for the system on which the directory is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.

And for each of the file-based resources (**cookbook_file**, **file**, **remote_file**, and **template**):

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``mode``
     - If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the chef-client assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the chef-client uses the default value of ``'0755'``.

**batch** Resource 
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_batch_21

Use the **batch** resource to execute a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter. The **batch** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. This resource inherits actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``) and properties (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) from the **execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_batch_syntax

A **batch** resource block executes a batch script using the cmd.exe interpreter:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'echo some env vars' do
     code <<-EOH
       echo %TEMP%
       echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%
       echo %PATH%
       echo %WINDIR%
       EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **batch** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   batch 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array
     creates                    String
     cwd                        String
     flags                      String
     group                      String, Integer
     guard_interpreter          Symbol
     interpreter                String
     notifies                   # see description
     provider                   Chef::Provider::Batch
     returns                    Integer, Array
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    Integer, Float
     user                       String, Integer
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :run if not specified
   end

where

* ``batch`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``command`` is the command to be run and ``cwd`` is the location from which the command is run
* ``:action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``code``, ``command``, ``creates``, ``cwd``, ``flags``, ``group``, ``guard_interpreter``, ``interpreter``, ``provider``, ``returns``, ``timeout``, and ``user`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown.

**powershell_script** Resource 
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resource_powershell_script_21

Use the **powershell_script** resource to execute a script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter, much like how the **script** and **script**-based resources---**bash**, **csh**, **perl**, **python**, and **ruby**---are used. The **powershell_script** is specific to the Microsoft Windows platform and the Windows PowerShell interpreter.

The **powershell_script** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag resource_powershell_script_syntax

A **powershell_script** resource block executes a batch script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter. For example, writing to an interpolated path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'write-to-interpolated-path' do
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **powershell_script** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array

knife.rb Settings
-----------------------------------------------------
New settings have been added to the knife.rb file:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``versioned_cookbooks``
     - Append cookbook versions to cookbooks. Set to ``false`` to hide cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache``. Set to ``true`` to show cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.0`` and/or ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.1``. When this setting is ``true``, ``knife download`` downloads ALL cookbook versions, which can be useful if a full-fidelity backup of data on the Chef server is required. For example:

       .. code-block:: ruby

          versioned_cookbooks true

chef-solo Environments
-----------------------------------------------------
chef-solo now supports environments.

.. tag chef_solo_environments

An environment is defined using JSON or the Ruby DSL. chef-solo will look for environments in ``/var/chef/environments``, but this location can be modified by changing the setting for ``environment_path`` in solo.rb. For example, the following setting in solo.rb:

.. code-block:: ruby

   environment_path '/var/chef-solo/environments'

Environment data looks like the following in JSON:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "dev",
     "default_attributes": {
       "apache2": {
         "listen_ports": [
           "80",
           "443"
         ]
       }
     },
     "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
       "description": "",
       "cookbook_versions": {
       "couchdb": "= 11.0.0"
     },
     "chef_type": "environment"
     }

and like the following in the Ruby DSL:

.. code-block:: ruby

   name 'environment_name'
   description 'environment_description'
   cookbook OR cookbook_versions  'cookbook' OR 'cookbook' => 'cookbook_version'
   default_attributes 'node' => { 'attribute' => [ 'value', 'value', 'etc.' ] }
   override_attributes 'node' => { 'attribute' => [ 'value', 'value', 'etc.' ] }

.. end_tag

solo.rb
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A new setting has been added to the solo.rb file:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``environment_path``
     - The path to the environment.  Default value: ``/var/chef/environments``. For example:

       .. code-block:: ruby

          environment_path "/var/chef/environments"

Force a Redeploy
-----------------------------------------------------
Previous versions required the cache file to be deleted to force a redeploy. In chef-client 11.6, in addition to deleting the cache file, deleting the deployment directory will also force a redeploy.
