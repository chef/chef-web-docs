About Files
=====================================================

Files are managed using the following resources:

   * Use the :doc:`cookbook_file <resource_cookbook_file>` resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the ``/files`` directory in a cookbook.
   * Use the :doc:`file <resource_file>` resource to manage files directly on a node.
   * Use the :doc:`remote_file <resource_remote_file>` resource to transfer files to nodes from remote locations.
   * Use the :doc:`template <resource_template>` resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the ``/templates`` directory in a cookbook.
