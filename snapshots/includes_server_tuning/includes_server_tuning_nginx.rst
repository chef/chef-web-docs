The following settings are often modified from the default as part of the tuning effort for the **nginx** service and to configure the Chef server to use SSL certificates:

``nginx['ssl_certificate']``
   The SSL certificate used to verify communication over HTTPS. Default value: ``nil``.

``nginx['ssl_certificate_key']``
   The certificate key used for SSL communication. Default value: ``nil``.

``nginx['ssl_ciphers']``
   The list of supported cipher suites that are used to establish a secure connection. To favor AES256 with ECDHE forward security, drop the ``RC4-SHA:RC4-MD5:RC4:RSA`` prefix. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      nginx['ssl_ciphers'] =  "HIGH:MEDIUM:!LOW:!kEDH: \
                               !aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!EXP: \
                               !SSLv2:!SEED:!CAMELLIA: \
                               !PSK"


``nginx['ssl_protocols']``
   The SSL protocol versions that are enabled. SSL 3.0 is supported by the Chef server; however, SSL 3.0 is an obsolete and insecure protocol. Transport Layer Security (TLS)---TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2---has effectively replaced SSL 3.0, which provides for authenticated version negotiation between the chef-client and Chef server, which ensures the latest version of the TLS protocol is used. For the highest possible security, it is recommended to disable SSL 3.0 and allow all versions of the TLS protocol.  For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      nginx['ssl_protocols'] = "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"

.. note:: See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS for more information about the values used with the ``nginx['ssl_ciphers']`` and ``nginx['ssl_protocols']`` settings.

For example, after copying the SSL certificate files to the Chef server, update the ``nginx['ssl_certificate']`` and ``nginx['ssl_certificate_key']`` settings to specify the paths to those files, and then (optionally) update the ``nginx['ssl_ciphers']`` and ``nginx['ssl_protocols']`` settings to reflect the desired level of hardness for the Chef server:

.. code-block:: ruby

   nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "/etc/pki/tls/private/name.of.pem"
   nginx['ssl_certificate_key'] = "/etc/pki/tls/private/name.of.key"
   nginx['ssl_ciphers'] = "HIGH:MEDIUM:!LOW:!kEDH:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!EXP:!SSLv2:!SEED:!CAMELLIA:!PSK"
   nginx['ssl_protocols'] = "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
