Using the **dsc_resource** has the following requirements:

* Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 February Preview (or higher), which includes Windows PowerShell 5.0.10018.0 (or higher).
* The ``RefreshMode`` configuration setting in the Local Configuration Manager must be set to ``Disabled``.

  **NOTE:** Starting with the chef-client 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the chef-client from running in non-disabled refresh mode.

* The **dsc_script** resource  may not be used in the same run-list with the **dsc_resource**. This is because the **dsc_script** resource requires that ``RefreshMode`` in the Local Configuration Manager be set to ``Push``, whereas the **dsc_resource** resource requires it to be set to ``Disabled``.

  **NOTE:** Starting with the chef-client 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the chef-client from running in non-disabled refresh mode, which allows the Local Configuration Manager to be set to ``Push``.

* The **dsc_resource** resource can only use binary- or script-based resources. Composite DSC resources may not be used.

  This is because composite resources aren't "real" resources from the perspective of the the Local Configuration Manager (LCM). Composite resources are used by the "configuration" keyword from the ``PSDesiredStateConfiguration`` module, and then evaluated in that context. When using DSC to create the configuration document (the Managed Object Framework (MOF) file) from the configuration command, the composite resource is evaluated. Any individual resources from that composite resource are written into the Managed Object Framework (MOF) document. As far as the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) is concerned, there is no such thing as a composite resource. Unless that changes, the **dsc_resource** resource and/or ``Invoke-DscResource`` command cannot directly use them.
