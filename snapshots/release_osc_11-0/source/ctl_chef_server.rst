This command has the following syntax::

   chef-server-ctl OPTION

This command has the following options:

``tail [SERVICE_NAME]``
   Follow the Chef server logs for all services or for a single service.

   Execute chef-pedant, an integration test suite for the Chef server installation. By default, only a subset of the available test are run. Add the ``--all`` flag to run the full test suite.
