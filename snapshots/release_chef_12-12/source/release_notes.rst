=====================================================

.. tag chef

Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Whether youâ€™re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.

This diagram shows how you develop, test, and deploy your Chef code.

What's New
=====================================================
The following items are new for chef-client 12.12 and/or are changes from previous versions. The short version:

* **New node attribute APIs** Common set of methods to read, write, delete, and check if node attributes exist.
* **Data collector updates** Minor enhancements to data that the data collector reports on.
* **knife cookbook create has been deprecated** You should use chef generate cookbook instead.

New node attribute read, write, unlink, and exist? APIs
-----------------------------------------------------------
The four methods ``read``, ``write``, ``unlink``, and ``exist?`` (and their corresponding unsafe versions) can be used on node objects to set, retrieve, delete, and validate existance of attributes.

read/read!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use the ``read`` method to retrieve an attribute value on a node object. It is a safe, non-autovivifying reader that returns ``nil`` if the attribute does not exist.

``node.read("foo", "bar", "baz")`` is equivalent to ``node["foo"]["bar"]["baz"]`` but returns ``nil`` instead of raising an exception when no value is set.

The ``read!`` method is a non-autovivifying reader that also retrieves an attribute value on a node object; however, it will throw a NoMethodError exception if the attribute does not exist.

On the node level, ``node.default.read/read!("foo")`` behaves similarly to ``node.read("foo")``, but only on the default level.

write/write!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use the ``write`` method set an attribute value on a node object. It is a safe, autovivifying writer that replaces intermediate non-hash objects.

``node.write(:default, "foo", "bar", "baz")`` is equivalent to ``node.default["foo"]["bar"] = "baz"``.

The ``write!`` method is also an autovivifying method to set an attribute value on a node object; however, it will throw an NoSuchAttribute exception if there is a non-hash on an intermediate key.

.. note:: There is currently no non-autovivifying writer method for attributes.

On the node level, ``node.default.write/write!("foo", "bar")`` is equivalent to ``node.write/write!(:default, "foo", "bar")``.

unlink/unlink!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use the ``unlink`` method to delete an attribute on a node object. ``nil`` will be returned if the value is not a valid Hash or Array.

The ``unlink!`` method also deletes an attribute on a node object; however, it will throw a NoSuchAttribute exception if the attribute does not exist.

On the node level, ``node.default.unlink/unlink!("foo")`` is equivalent to ``node.unlink/unlink!(:default, "foo")``.

exist?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use the ``exist?`` method to check whether the attribute exists. For example, ``node.exist?("foo", "bar")`` can be used to see if ``node["foo"]["bar"]`` exists.

On the node level, ``node.default.exist?("foo", "bar")`` can be used to see if ``node.default["foo"]["bar"]`` exists.

Depreciated node attribute methods
--------------------------------------------------------
The following methods have been deprecated in this release:

* ``node.set``
* ``node.set_unless``

data_collector updates
-----------------------------------------------------
* Adds ``node`` to the data_collector message.
* ``data_collector`` reports on all resources and not just those that have been processed.
