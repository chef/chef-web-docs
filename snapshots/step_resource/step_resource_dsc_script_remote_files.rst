   remote_file "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}\\DSCResourceKit620082014.zip" do
     source 'http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DSC-Resource-Kit-All-c449312d/file/124481/1/DSC%20Resource%20Kit%20Wave%206%2008282014.zip'
   end
   
   dsc_script 'get-dsc-resource-kit' do
     code <<-EOH
       Archive reskit
       {
         ensure = 'Present'
         path = "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}\\DSCResourceKit620082014.zip"
         destination = "#{ENV['PROGRAMW6432']}\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules"
