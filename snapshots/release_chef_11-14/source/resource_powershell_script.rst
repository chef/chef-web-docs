powershell_script
=====================================================

.. tag resource_powershell_script_21

Use the **powershell_script** resource to execute a script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter, much like how the **script** and **script**-based resources---**bash**, **csh**, **perl**, **python**, and **ruby**---are used. The **powershell_script** is specific to the Microsoft Windows platform and the Windows PowerShell interpreter.

The **powershell_script** resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.

.. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag 16_22

A **powershell_script** resource block executes a batch script using the Windows PowerShell interpreter. For example, writing to an interpolated path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'write-to-interpolated-path' do
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **powershell_script** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'name' do
     architecture               Symbol
     code                       String
     command                    String, Array
     convert_boolean_return     TrueClass, FalseClass
     flags                      String
     interpreter                String
     notifies                   # see description
     provider                   Chef::Provider::PowershellScript
     subscribes                 # see description
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :run if not specified
   end

where

* ``powershell_script`` is the resource
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block
* ``command`` is the command to be run and ``cwd`` is the location from which the command is run
* ``:action`` identifies the steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``architecture``, ``code``, ``command``, ``convert_boolean_return``, ``flags``, ``interpreter``, and ``provider`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
=====================================================
.. tag resource_powershell_script_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:nothing``
   Inherited from **execute** resource. Prevent a command from running. This action is used to specify that a command is run only when another resource notifies it.

``:run``
   Default. Run the script.

.. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
.. tag 16_21

This resource has the following properties:

``architecture``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

   The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If a value is not provided, the chef-client defaults to the correct value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is raised when anything other than ``:i386`` is specified for a 32-bit process. Possible values: ``:i386`` (for 32-bit processes) and ``:x86_64`` (for 64-bit processes).

``code``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

``command``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The name of the command to be executed. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``convert_boolean_return``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Return ``0`` if the last line of a command is evaluated to be true or to return ``1`` if the last line is evaluated to be false. Default value: ``false``.

   .. tag resource_powershell_script_attributes_guard_interpreter

   When the ``guard_intrepreter`` common attribute is set to ``:powershell_script``, a string command will be evaluated as if this value were set to ``true``. This is because the behavior of this attribute is similar to the value of the ``"$?"`` expression common in UNIX interpreters. For example, this:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      powershell_script 'make_safe_backup' do
        guard_interpreter :powershell_script
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test-path ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end

   is similar to:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      bash 'make_safe_backup' do
        code 'cp ~/data/nodes.json ~/data/nodes.bak'
        not_if 'test -e ~/data/nodes.bak'
      end

   .. end_tag

``flags``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   A string that is passed to the Windows PowerShell command. Default value: ``-NoLogo, -NonInteractive, -NoProfile, -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned, -InputFormat None, -File``.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``interpreter``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the default value of this property is not supported.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag 5_3

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag 5_3

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

.. end_tag

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of the chef-client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell the chef-client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for the chef-client to do nothing.

.. end_tag

**Attributes**

.. tag resources_common_guards_attributes

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of the chef-client run:

``not_if``
   Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
   Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag

**Arguments**

.. tag resources_common_guards_arguments

The following arguments can be used with the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` guard properties:

``:user``
   Specify the user that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :user => 'adam'

``:group``
   Specify the group that a command will run as. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :group => 'adam'

``:environment``
   Specify a Hash of environment variables to be set. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam /etc/passwd', :environment => { 
        'HOME' => '/home/adam' 
      }

``:cwd``
   Set the current working directory before running a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'grep adam passwd', :cwd => '/etc'

``:timeout``
   Set a timeout for a command. For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      not_if 'sleep 10000', :timeout => 10

.. end_tag

Providers
=====================================================
.. tag resources_common_provider

Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_provider_attributes

The chef-client will determine the correct provider based on configuration data collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run. This configuration data is then mapped to a platform and an associated list of providers.

Generally, it's best to let the chef-client choose the provider, and this is (by far) the most common approach. However, in some cases, specifying a provider may be desirable. There are two approaches:

* Use a more specific short name---``yum_package "foo" do`` instead of ``package "foo" do``, ``script "foo" do`` instead of ``bash "foo" do``, and so on---when available
* Use the ``provider`` property within the resource block to specify the long name of the provider as a property of a resource. For example: ``provider Chef::Provider::Long::Name``

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_powershell_script_providers

This resource has the following providers:

``Chef::Provider::PowershellScript``, ``powershell_script``
   The default provider for all platforms.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Write to an interpolated path**

.. tag resource_powershell_write_to_interpolated_path

.. To write out to an interpolated path:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'write-to-interpolated-path' do
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Change the working directory**

.. tag resource_powershell_cwd

.. To use the change working directory (``cwd``) attribute:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'cwd-then-write' do
     cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "C:/powershell-test2.txt"
     $pwd = pwd
     $stream.WriteLine("This is the contents of: $pwd")
     $dirs = dir
     foreach ($dir in $dirs) {
       $stream.WriteLine($dir.fullname)
     }
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Change the working directory in Microsoft Windows**

.. tag resource_powershell_cwd_microsoft_env

.. To change the working directory to a Microsoft Windows environment variable:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'cwd-to-win-env-var' do
     cwd '%TEMP%'
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./temp-write-from-chef.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("chef on windows rox yo!")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Pass an environment variable to a script**

.. tag resource_powershell_pass_env_to_script

.. To pass a Microsoft Windows environment variable to a script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'read-env-var' do
     cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
     environment ({'foo' => 'BAZ'})
     code <<-EOH
     $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./test-read-env-var.txt"
     $stream.WriteLine("FOO is $env:foo")
     $stream.close()
     EOH
   end

.. end_tag

**Evaluate for true and/or false**

.. tag resource_powershell_convert_boolean_return

.. To return ``0`` for true, ``1`` for false:

Use the ``convert_boolean_return`` attribute to raise an exception when certain conditions are met. For example, the following fragments will run successfully without error:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'false' do
     code '$false'
   end

and:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'true' do
     code '$true'
   end

whereas the following will raise an exception:

.. code-block:: ruby

   powershell_script 'false' do
     convert_boolean_return true
     code '$false'
   end

.. end_tag
