Chef Push Jobs 2.1
=====================================================

.. tag push_jobs_1

Chef push jobs is an extension of the Chef server that allows jobs to be run against nodes independently of a chef-client run. A job is an action or a command to be executed against a subset of nodes; the nodes against which a job is run are determined by the results of a search query made to the Chef server.

Chef push jobs uses the Chef server API and a Ruby client to initiate all connections to the Chef server. Connections use the same authentication and authorization model as any other request made to the Chef server. A knife plugin is used to initiate job creation and job tracking.

.. end_tag

Install :doc:`Push Jobs <install_push_jobs>` using the **push-jobs** cookbook and a chef-client run on each of the target nodes.

Requirements
=====================================================
Chef push jobs has the following requirements:

* An on-premises Chef server version 12.6 (or later); Chef push jobs is not supported when running Chef with the hosted Chef server
* To use the **push-jobs** cookbook to configure the Chef push jobs client, the chef-client must also be present on the node (because only the chef-client can use a cookbook to configure a node)
* .. tag server_firewalls_and_ports_push_jobs

  TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10002. TCP/10000 is the default heartbeat port. TCP/10002 is the command port. It may be configured in the Chef push jobs configuration file . This port allows Chef push jobs clients to communicate with the Chef push jobs server. In a configuration with both front and back ends, this port only needs to be open on the back end servers. The Chef push jobs server waits for connections from the Chef push jobs client, and never initiates a connection to a Chef push jobs client.

  .. end_tag

Components
=====================================================
Chef push jobs has three main components: jobs (managed by the Chef push jobs server), a client that is installed on every node in the organization, and one (or more) workstations from which job messages are initiated.

All communication between these components is done with the following:

* A heartbeat message between the Chef push jobs server and each managed node
* A knife plugin named ``knife push jobs`` with four subcommands: ``job list``, ``job start``, ``job status``, ``job output``, and ``node status``
* Various job messages sent from a workstation to the Chef push jobs server
* A single job message that is sent (per job) from the Chef push jobs server to one (or more) nodes that are being managed by the Chef server

The following diagram shows the various components of Chef push jobs:

.. image:: ../../images/overview_push_jobs_states.png

Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag push_jobs_component_jobs

The Chef push jobs server is used to send job messages to one (or more) managed nodes and also to manage the list of jobs that are available to be run against nodes.

A heartbeat message is used to let all of the nodes in an organization know that the Chef push jobs server is available. The Chef push jobs server listens for heartbeat messages from each Chef push jobs client. If there is no heartbeat from a Chef push jobs client, the Chef push jobs server will mark that node as unavailable for job messages until the heartbeat resumes.

.. end_tag

Nodes
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag push_jobs_component_nodes

The Chef push jobs client is used to receive job messages from the Chef push jobs server and to verify the heartbeat status. The Chef push jobs client uses the same authorization / authentication model as the chef-client. The Chef push jobs client listens for heartbeat messages from the Chef push jobs server. If there is no heartbeat from the Chef push jobs server, the Chef push jobs client will finish its current job, but then stop accepting any new jobs until the heartbeat from the Chef push jobs server resumes.

.. end_tag

Workstations
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag push_jobs_component_workstations

A workstation is used to manage Chef push jobs jobs, including maintaining the **push-jobs** cookbook, using knife to start and stop jobs, view job status, and to manage job lists.

.. end_tag

**push-jobs** Cookbook
=====================================================
The **push-jobs** cookbook contains attributes that are used to configure the Chef push jobs client. In addition, Chef push jobs relies on the ``whitelist`` attribute to manage the list of jobs (and commands) that are available to Chef push jobs.

Whitelist
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag push_jobs_whitelist

A whitelist is a list of jobs and commands that are used by Chef push jobs. A whitelist is saved as an attribute in the **push-jobs** cookbook. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default['push_jobs']['whitelist'] = {
     'job_name' => 'command',
   }

The whitelist is accessed from a recipe using the ``node['push_jobs']['whitelist]`` attribute. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template 'name' do
     source 'name'
     ...
     variables(:whitelist => node['push_jobs']['whitelist'])
   end

Use the ``knife exec`` subcommand to add a job to the whitelist. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("name:A_NODE_NAME") do |n|
       n.set["push_jobs"]["whitelist"]["ntpdate"] = "ntpdate -u time"
     end'

where ``["ntpdate"] = "ntpdate -u time"`` is added to the whitelist:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default['push_jobs']['whitelist'] = {
     "ntpdate" => "ntpdate -u time",
   }

.. end_tag

.. Install this plugin
.. -----------------------------------------------------
.. .. include:: ../../step_plugin_knife/step_plugin_knife_push_jobs_install_rubygem.rst

job list
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_list

Use the ``job list`` argument to view a list of Chef push jobs jobs.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_list_syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job list

.. end_tag

Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This command does not have any specific options.

job output
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_output

The ``job output`` command is used to view the output of Push jobs. The output capture flag must have been set on ``job start``; see the ``--capture`` option.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_output_syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job output (options) JOB_ID [NODE_NAME]

.. end_tag

Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_output_options

This argument has the following options:

``--channel [stderr | stdout]``
  The output channel to capture.

.. end_tag

Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**View the STDOUT for job with ID 26e98ba162fa7ba6fb2793125553c7ae**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job output 26e98ba162fa7ba6fb2793125553c7ae --channel stdout

job start
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start

Use the ``job start`` argument to start a Chef push jobs job.

.. end_tag

Syntax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag plugin_knife_push_jobs_job_start_syntax

This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife job start (options) COMMAND [NODE, NODE, ...]

.. end_tag

Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag 1_4

This argument has the following options:

``--timeout TIMEOUT``
   The maximum amount of time (in seconds) by which a job must complete, before it is stopped.

``-q QUORUM``, ``--quorum QUORUM``
   The minimum number of nodes that match the search criteria, are available, and acknowledge the job request. This can be expressed as a percentage (e.g. ``50%``) or as an absolute number of nodes (e.g. ``145``). Default value: ``100%``.

   For example, there are ten total nodes. If ``--quorum 80%`` is used and eight of those nodes acknowledge the job request, the command will be run against all of the available nodes. If two of the nodes were unavailable, the command would still be run against the remaining eight available nodes because quorum was met.

``-b``, ``--nowait``
   Exit immediately after starting a job instead of waiting for it to complete.

``--with-env ENVIRONMENT``
   Accept a JSON blob of environment variables and use those to set the variables for the client. For example ``'{"test": "foo"}'`` will set the push client environment variable "test" to "foo".

``--in-dir DIR``
   Execute the remote command in the directory ``DIR``.

``--file DATAFILE``
  Send the file to the client. Cleaned

``--capture``
  Capture stdin and stdout for this job.

jobs/ID/output/NODE_NAME/CHANNEL
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_output

It is possible to capture the output of commands invoked by Push Jobs, both STDOUT and STDERR, by
providing the ``capture_output=true`` option when creating a job.

If capture is enabled, then the client will capture both the stdout and the stderr channels of the command.
The channel output will be sent back regardless of whether the command succeeded or failed. It will be sent in raw
form, including any terminating whitespace. If the command produced no output, then the value will be an empty string.

The two channels are treated as a pair -- for a given ``<job, node>``, either both will appear, or neither will appear.

The output is not streamed to the server as it is produced. Therefore, the output data for a given node will not
be available until the run on that node is complete.

.. end_tag

GET

jobs_status_feed
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_status_feed

The ``/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``

.. end_tag

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_status_feed_get

This endpoint opens a Server-Sent-Events (SSE) feed for job starts and completions within the entire organization.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be ``application/event-stream``.

As specified in the SSE protocol, you may request all events since a particular ID by including the optional ``Last-Event-ID`` Header.
If this header is not included, no events will be produced until the next activity in the organization produces an event. If the ``Last-Event-ID``
header is passed but not recognized, it is assumed that the ID has already expired, and the feed will produce the events as far back as are recorded,
proceeded by a synthetic ``start_of_history``. The expiration time of organization events is 60 seconds (configurable).

jobs_status_feed/JOBID

.. tag api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_status_feed_id

The ``/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed/JOBID`` endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``

.. end_tag

GET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. tag api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_status_feed_id_get

This endpoint opens a Server-Sent-Events (SSE) feed with the Push Jobs server.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be ``application/event-stream``.

As specified in the SSE protocol, you may request all events since a particular ID by including the optional ``Last-Event-ID`` Header.
If the ID is omitted, or not recognized, the stream will start from the beginning of the job.

**Completed Jobs**

In the job feed, for a brief period after a job completes, the event stream will remain available. The request will behave as normal,
which means the client will see the stream of events from the beginning of the job (or if specified, the ``Last-Event-ID``), through to
the job completion, and then the connection will be immediately closed by the server. The amount of time before it completes is configurable,
but defaults to 5 seconds.

If a request is made for the feed after the waiting period, then the request will result in a single event, a "summary" event, which contains
the same data as requesting a named-job resource. In this case, any ``Last-Event-ID`` will be ignored.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   Accept: text/event-stream
   GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed/JOBID
