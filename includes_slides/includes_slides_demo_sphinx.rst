|python sphinx| is a document authoring platform that:

* Uses a whitespace-delimited authoring format called |rst| (and is similar to |markdown|)
* Uses the docutils parser/library---builds to HTML, PDF, man-page, |revealjs| (slide decks), and other formats
* Is |python|-based---can be extended using the |python| platform
* Does way more than render pages, it also tests the page and ensures valid content and structure
* Separates source (.rst files), structure ("map files"), and presentation (CSS, etc.)
* Composable, reusable, and delightful
