The following settings are typically added to the server configuration file (please note that there is no equal sign necessary to set the value):

``api_fqdn``
   The |fqdn| for the |chef server|. This setting is not in the server configuration file by default. When added, its value should be equal to the |fqdn| for the service URI used by the |chef server|. For example: ``api_fqdn "chef.example.com"``.

``bootstrap``
   Default value: ``true``.

``ip_version``
   Use to set the IP version: ``"ipv4"`` or ``"ipv6"``. When set to ``"ipv6"``, the API listens on IPv6 and front end and back end services communicate via IPv6 when a high availability configuration is used. When configuring for IPv6 in a high availability configuration, be sure to set the netmask on the IPv6 ``backend_vip`` attribute. Default value: ``"ipv4"``.

``notification_email``
   Default value: ``info@example.com``.
