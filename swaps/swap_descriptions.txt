Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version does not exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| ensures that any conflicted cookbooks are not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs.
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Show that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (|ruby less|), ``<=`` (|ruby less_or_equal|), ``=`` (|ruby equal|), ``>=`` (|ruby greater_optimistic|), ``~>`` (|ruby greater_pessimistic|), or ``>`` (|ruby greater|). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exists on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| includes the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, the |chef client| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.

Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.

.. |mode resource_directory| replace::  If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| assumes a mask value of ``'0777'``, and then applies the umask for the system on which the directory is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the |chef client| uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
.. |mode resource_directory_11-4| replace::  If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the directory is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the |chef client| uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
.. |mode resource_file| replace:: If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| assumes a mask value of ``'0777'`` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the |chef client| uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
.. |mode resource_file_11-4| replace:: If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| assumes a mask value of ``'0777'` and then applies the umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``'022'``, the |chef client| uses the default value of ``'0755'``.
.. |mode *nix| replace:: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is passed to |chmod|. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``'00755'``. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it works exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``'0777'`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``'01777'`` or ``'1777'``.
.. |mode windows security| replace:: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode that is translated into rights for |windows| security. For example: ``'755'``, ``'0755'``, or ``'00755'``. Values up to ``'0777'`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in |windows| as they do in |unix|, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This property cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This property has no effect if not specified, but when it and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects are cumulative.
.. |month cron| replace:: The month in the year on which a |cron| entry is to run (1 - 12).
.. |mount_point| replace:: The directory (or path) in which the device is to be mounted.
