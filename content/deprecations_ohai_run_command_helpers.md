Ohai ships a command mixin for use by plugin authors in shelling out to
external commands. This mixin originally included `run_command` and
`popen4` methods, which were deprecated in Ohai 8.11.1 (Chef Client
12.8.1) in favor of the more robust `mixlib-shellout` gem functionality.
In Chef Client 13 these deprecated methods will be removed, breaking any
Ohai plugins authored using the deprecated methods.

## Remediation

Plugins should be updated to use mixlib-shellout instead of the
run_command.

Deprecated run_command based code:

```ruby
status, stdout, stderr = run_command(command: 'myapp --version')
if status == 0
  version = stdout
end
```

Updated code for mixlib shellout:

```ruby
so = shell_out('myapp --version')
if so.exitstatus == 0
  version = so.stdout
end
```

See the [mixlib-shellout repo](https://github.com/chef/mixlib-shellout)
for additional usage information.
