The Chef community is an active, caring, wickedly smart, and fast
growing group of practitioners who want to help you succeed with Chef.
There are a number of ways for you to engage with, learn from, follow,
and contribute, such as reading books, going to meetups, listening to
podcasts, taking some training, and simply being a part of the
community.
