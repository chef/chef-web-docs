Enterprise Chef is the commercial offering of the Chef software suite. This version builds upon the core functionalities of open-source Chef, including advanced features, timely support and enhanced capabilities. All of which are designed to meet the needs of larger organizations and complex infrastructures.

Features available in the Enterprise version that cannot be availed in the community edition include a GUI (graphical user interface), an analytics dashboard, a bulk grouping tool, customizable views, push functionality, and more.

For enterprises prioritizing scale and technical debt, the commercial version of Chef is the ideal choice. We strongly recommend Enterprise Chef, which provides advanced features, enhanced visibility and exceptional support, giving it an edge over the Community version.

You can find a detailed list of features and services available on the Enterprise version <here>.
