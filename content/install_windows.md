Infra Client on a Microsoft Windows machine at [Chef

### Run as a Scheduled Task

Chef Infra Client can be run as a scheduled task. On the Microsoft
Windows platform, a scheduled task provides more visibility,
configurability, and reliability around log rotation and permissions, as
compared to running Chef Infra Client as a service. A scheduled task:

-   Prevents log rotation issues, such as filling a disk partition
-   Does not have an indeterminate status, such as a service for which
    only the watcher is "running"
-   Prevents insufficient permissions related to service context
-   Prevents issues related to a system reboot
