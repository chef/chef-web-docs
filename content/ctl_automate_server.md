cleanse
=======

The `cleanse` subcommand is used to re-set the Chef Automate server to
the state it was in prior to the first time the `reconfigure` subcommand
is run. This command will:

-   Destroy all data and logs
-   Create a backup of the system config files and place them in a
    directory in root, such as `/root/delivery-cleanse-2015-12-15T15:51`

The software that was put on-disk by the package installation will
remain. Re-run `automate-ctl reconfigure` to recreate the default data
and configuration files.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` none
automate-ctl cleanse
```

create-backup
=============

{{% automate_ctl_create_backup %}}

The `delete-elasticsearch-lock` subcommand is used to delete the
exclusive Elasticsearch lock document that is used by several of Chef
Automate's services to coordinate major operations. Each service should
create and remove this lock automatically, but in the event of an issue
an operator can use this command to manually free the lock. The
`--stale-lock-only` option (added in Chef Automate 1.8.3) ensures that a
lock is only deleted if it is older than the currently running
Elasticsearch process.

Added in Chef Automate version 1.6.87.

**Syntax**

``` bash
automate-ctl delete-elasticsearch-lock [options]
     --force                      Agree to all warnings and prompts
     --stale-lock-only            Only delete the lock if it is older than the Elasticsearch process
 -h, --help                       Show the usage message
     --stale-lock-only            Cleans stale lock files
```

**Examples**

``` bash
automate-ctl delete-elasticsearch-lock

HOSTNAME            PROCESS  PID    TIME
automate.myorg.com  reaper   12345  2017-08-11T16:46:33Z

into a compressed file archive. It will create a tbz2 file in the
current working directory, with the timestamp as the file name.

By default, it collects the most current log file as well as any others
that have been modified in the last 180 minutes. If the `--all-logs`
option is given, all log files are collected.

**Syntax**

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl gather-logs
      --all-logs          Gather all of the logs, regardless of size or age.
```

{{< warning >}}

The `--all-logs` option can potentially take up a large amount of disk
space.

{{< /warning >}}

generate-password-reset-token
=============================

The `generate-password-reset-token` command is used to unset the
password for an existing Chef Automate user, and generate a token that
allows them to set a new password. The command returns a URL pointing to
the Chef Automate UI, allowing the user to enter a new password.

The token is embedded in that URL and has an expiry of two hours. This
command may be issued again to get a new token. After the command has
been run, the previously stored password will no longer work. Issued API
tokens (e.g. in existing UI sessions or for use with the [Delivery
CLI](/delivery_cli/)) will not be revoked.

When a token is consumed (through the web UI), all issued password reset
tokens for this user will be revoked.

**Syntax**

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl generate-password-reset-token ENTERPRISE_NAME USER_NAME
```

**Example**

``` bash
automate-ctl generate-password-reset-token Chef admin

runner, so custom configurations can be installed on the runner by using
the [client.d copying feature](/workstation/knife_bootstrap/). All config files
inside `~/.chef/client.d` directory on the Chef Automate server get
copied into the `/etc/chef/client.d` directory on the runner.

Service Subcommands
===================

{{% ctl_common_service_subcommands %}}

graceful-kill
-------------

The `kill` subcommand is used to send a `SIGKILL` to all services. This
command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name
of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl kill name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

hup
---

The `hup` subcommand is used to send a `SIGHUP` to all services. This
command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name
of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl hup name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

int
---

The `int` subcommand is used to send a `SIGINT` to all services. This
command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name
of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl int name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

kill
----

The `kill` subcommand is used to send a `SIGKILL` to all services. This
command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name
of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl kill name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

once
----

The supervisor for the Chef Automate server is configured to restart any
service that fails, unless that service has been asked to change its
state. The `once` subcommand is used to tell the supervisor to not
attempt to restart any service that fails.

This command is useful when troubleshooting configuration errors that
prevent a service from starting. Run the `once` subcommand followed by
the `status` subcommand to look for services in a down state and/or to
identify which services are in trouble. This command can also be run for
an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the
command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl once name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

restart
-------

The `restart` subcommand is used to restart all services enabled on the
Chef Automate server, or to restart an individual service by specifying
the name of that service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl restart name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand. When a service is
successfully restarted the output should be similar to:

``` bash
ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s
```

service-list
------------

The `service-list` subcommand is used to display a list of all available
services. A service that is enabled is labeled with an asterisk (\*).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl service-list
```

start
-----

The `start` subcommand is used to start all services that are enabled in
the Chef Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual
service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl start name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand. When a service is
successfully started the output should be similar to:

``` bash
ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s
```

The supervisor for the Chef Automate server is configured to wait seven
seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If
you see output that references a timeout, it means that a signal has
been sent to the process, but that the process has yet to actually
comply. In general, processes that have timed out are not a big concern,
unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all. If a process
is not responding, use a command like the `kill` subcommand to stop the
process, investigate the cause (if required), and then use the `start`
subcommand to re-enable it.

status
------

The `status` subcommand is used to show the status of all services
available to the Chef Automate server. The results will vary based on
the configuration of a given server. This subcommand has the following
syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl status
```

and will return the status for all services. Status can be returned for
individual services by specifying the name of the service as part of the
command:

``` bash
automate-ctl status name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

When service status is requested, the output should be similar to:

``` bash
run: service_name: (pid 12345) 12345s; run: log: (pid 1234) 67890s
```

where

-   `run:` is the state of the service (`run:` or `down:`)
-   `service_name:` is the name of the service for which status is
    returned
-   `(pid 12345)` is the process identifier
-   `12345s` is the uptime of the service, in seconds

For example:

``` bash
down: opscode-erchef: (pid 35546) 10s
```

By default, runit will restart services automatically when the services
fail. Therefore, runit may report the status of a service as `run:` even
when there is an issue with that service. When investigating why a
particular service is not running as it should be, look for the services
with the shortest uptimes. For example, the list below indicates that
the **opscode-erchef** should be investigated further:

``` bash
run: oc-id
run: opscode-chef: (pid 4327) 13671s; run: log: (pid 4326) 13671s
run: opscode-erchef: (pid 5383) 5s; run: log: (pid 4382) 13669s
run: opscode-expander: (pid 4078) 13694s; run: log: (pid 4077) 13694s
run: opscode-expander-reindexer: (pid 4130) 13692s; run: log: (pid 4114) 13692s
```

### Log Files

A typical status line for a service that is running any of the Chef
Automate server front-end services is similar to the following:

``` bash
run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s
```

where:

-   `run` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep
    processes. This state is either `run` or `down`. If a service is in
    a `down` state, it should be stopped
-   `name_of_service` is the service name, for example: `opscode-solr4`
-   `(pid 1486) 7819s;` is the process identifier followed by the amount
    of time (in seconds) the service has been running
-   `run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s` is the log process. It is typical for a
    log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is
    because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in
    order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the
following:

``` bash
down: opscode-solr4: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s
```

where

-   `down` indicates that the service is in a down state
-   `3s, normally up;` indicates that the service is normally in a run
    state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service
    after a reboot

stop
----

The `stop` subcommand is used to stop all services enabled on the Chef
Automate server. This command can also be run for an individual service
by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl stop name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand. When a service is
successfully stopped the output should be similar to:

``` bash
ok: diwb: service_name: 0s, normally up
```

For example:

``` bash
automate-ctl stop
```

will return something similar to:

``` bash
ok: down: nginx: 393s, normally up
ok: down: opscode-chef: 391s, normally up
ok: down: opscode-erchef: 391s, normally up
ok: down: opscode-expander: 390s, normally up
ok: down: opscode-expander-reindexer: 389s, normally up
ok: down: opscode-solr4: 389s, normally up
ok: down: postgresql: 388s, normally up
ok: down: rabbitmq: 388s, normally up
ok: down: redis_lb: 387s, normally up
```

tail
----

The `tail` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef Automate server
logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual
service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
automate-ctl tail name_of_service
```

where `name_of_service` represents the name of any service that is
listed after running the `service-list` subcommand.

term
----

The `term` subcommand is used to send a `SIGTERM` to all services. This
command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name
of the service in the command.
