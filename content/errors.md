The following sections describe how to troubleshoot the Chef Infra
Server, Chef Infra Client, and Chef Workstation.

## 401 Unauthorized

There are multiple causes of the Chef 401 "Unauthorized" error, so
please use the sections below to find the error message that most
closely matches your output. If you are unable to find a matching error,
or if the provided steps are unhelpful, please [file a help
ticket](https://getchef.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

### Failed to authenticate as ORGANIZATION-validator

If you're receiving an error like the following it most likely means
you'll need to regenerate the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file:

```bash
INFO: Client key /etc/chef/client.pem is not present - registering
INFO: HTTP Request Returned 401 Unauthorized: Failed to authenticate as ORGANIZATION-validator. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct.
FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to c:/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
FATAL: Net::HTTPClientException: 401 "Unauthorized"
```

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1.  Check if the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file exists in one of the
    following locations:

        ~/.chef
        ~/projects/current_project/.chef
        /etc/chef

    If one is present, verify that it has the correct read permissions.

2.  If there's no ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file, regenerate it.

    Recreate this file by going to the Chef management console web user
    interface and selecting **Organizations** in the upper right side of
    the screen.

    You can then select **Reset Validation Key** next to the
    organization for which the key is to be reset.

## Failed to authenticate to

When the values for certain settings in the client.rb file---`node_name`
and `client_key`---are incorrect, it will not be possible to
authenticate to the Chef Infra Server. An error similar to the following
is shown:

```bash
ERROR: Failed to authenticate to https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION as USERNAME with key /path/to/USERNAME.pem
Response:  Failed to authenticate as USERNAME. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct.
```

**Troubleshooting Steps**

-   Verify you have the correct values in your config.rb file,
    especially for the `node_name` and `client_key` settings.

-   Check if the file referenced in the `client_key` setting (usually
    USER.pem) exists. Some common locations include:

        - ~/.chef
        - ~/projects/current_project/.chef
        - /etc/chef

    If one is present, verify that it has the correct read permissions.

-   If there's no client.rb file, regenerate it and ensure the values
    for the `node_name` and `client_key` settings are correct.

### Organization not found

If you see this error when trying to recreate the
ORGANIZATION-validator.pem, it's possible that Chef Infra Client itself
was deleted. In this situation, the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem will need
to be recreated. In these directions, `ORGANIZATION` should be replaced
with the name of your organization.

### Synchronize the clock on your host

If the system clock drifts more than 15 minutes from the actual time,
the following type of error will be shown:

```bash
INFO: Client key /etc/chef/client.pem is not present - registering
INFO: HTTP Request Returned 401 Unauthorized: Failed to authenticate as ORGANIZATION-validator. Synchronize the clock on your host.
FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /var/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
FATAL: Net::HTTPClientException: 401 "Unauthorized"
```

To resolve this error, synchronize the clock with an NTP server.

### All other 401 errors

The general `Net::HTTPClientException: 401 "Unauthorized"` error will
usually occur for one of two reasons.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1.  Make sure your `client.pem` is valid.

    This can be fixed by deleting `client.pem` in `/etc/chef` and
    deleting the client and node with knife.

    On a management station:

    ```bash
    # Dump the current node to JSON
    knife node show NODE_NAME -fJ > NODE_NAME.json

    knife client delete FQDN -y
    knife node delete FQDN -y
    ```

    On an affected node (as root):

    ```bash
    rm /etc/chef/client.pem
    chef-client
    ```

    When Chef Infra Client runs, it will register the API client and
    generate the correct key.

    After successfully running Chef Infra Client on the node, reload the
    `run_list` and node attributes:

    ```bash
    knife node from file NODE_NAME.json
    ```

2.  Make sure to use the same `node_name` as the initial Chef Infra
    Client run.

    This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, if the
    client.rb file does not specify the correct node name and the
    system's hostname has changed.

    Running `chef-client -l debug` will identify the node name being
    used by Chef Infra Client for authentication attempts:

    ```bash
    DEBUG: Signing the request as SOME_NODE_NAME
    ```

    This can be fixed by explicitly setting `node_name` in the
    client.rb file to match the name originally used to register.

    ```ruby
    ```

    node_node 'mynode.mycompany.com'

    Alternatively, re-register the node using the method described
    previously.

## 403 Forbidden

If you're seeing output like this:

```bash
FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /var/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
FATAL: Net::HTTPClientException: 403 "Forbidden"
```

this is an indication that there is an issue with permissions on the
Chef Infra Server.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

In Chef, there are two different types of permissions issues, object
specific and global permissions. To figure out which type of permission
issue you're experiencing, run Chef Infra Client again using the
`-l debug` options to see debugging output.

You should see something like this up the stack trace:

```bash
DEBUG: Sending HTTP Request to https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ORGNAME/nodes
ERROR: Running exception handlers
```

The URL will help identify the type of permission issue. If the URL is
an index action (i.e. operating on a collection of resources, like
`/nodes`) then this is a global permission. If the URL is operating on
an instance of a collection (i.e. `/nodes/NODENAME`) then this is an
object permission issue.

To fix the global permissions:

1.  Log in to the Chef management console and click on the failing
    object type (most likely **Nodes**).

2.  Click on the **Permissions** sub-tab. Which permission it needs,
    depends on which request that failed:

    GET - Under the group section, make sure it has the LIST permission
    checked POST - Under the group section, make sure it has the CREATE
    permission checked

3.  Check the checkboxes needed and save the updates.

To fix object permissions:

1.  Log in to the Chef management console and click on the failing
    object type (most likely **Nodes**).

2.  Click on the object in the list that is causing the error.

3.  Click on the **Permissions** sub-tab. Which permission it needs,
    depends on the type of request that failed:

    GET - Make sure it has the READ permission checked PUT - Make sure
    it has the UPDATE permission checked DELETE - Make sure it has the
    DELETE permission checked

4.  Check the checkboxes needed and save the updates.

## 500 (Unexpected)

HTTP 500 is a non-specific error message. The full error message for the
error Chef Infra Client is receiving can be found in one of the
following log files:

-   `/var/log/opscode/opscode-account/current`
-   `/var/log/opscode/opscode-erchef/current`

The error will likely found in a stacktrace from the application error.
In some cases the error message will clearly indicate a problem with
another service which can be investigated further. For non-obvious
errors, please contact Chef and attach the log files.

## 502 / 504 (Gateway)

Determine which API service is returning 504s using the Nginx access
logs. API requests returning 504 can be found with the following command
on a frontend:

```bash
grep 'HTTP/1.1" 504' /var/log/opscode/nginx/access.log
```

The following will extract the URLs and sort them by `uniq` count:

```bash
grep 'HTTP/1.1" 504' nginx-access.log | cut -d' ' -f8 | sort | uniq -c | sort
```

In a large installation, you may need to restrict this to a subset of
the requests:

```bash
tail -10000 nginx-access.log | grep 'HTTP/1.1" 504' | cut -d' ' -f8 | sort | uniq -c | sort
```

You can also use the `ntail` utility.

If the problematic service is a Ruby-based service and the frontend
machines have free RAM or CPU, consider increasing the number of worker
processes. If the problematic service is **opscode-erchef**, use the
request log to determine whether a particular component of requests is
slow.

## Workflow Problems

In working with Chef, you'll most likely encounter issues in your
regular workflow. This page is a collection of common errors our users
have reported while working with Chef. Please use the accordion below to
select the error message that most closely matches your output. If you
are unable to find a matching error, or if the provided steps are
unhelpful, please [file a help
ticket](https://getchef.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

### No such file or directory

If you're seeing an error like:

```bash
Client key /etc/chef/client.pem is notresent - registering
WARN: Failed to read the private key /etc/che/validation.pem: #<Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/validation.pem>
FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /etc/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::PrivateKeyMissing: I cannot read /etc/chef/validation.pem, which you told me to use to sign requests
```

it means that Chef Infra Client could not find your validation.pem.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1.  Make sure your `validation.pem` or `ORGANIZATION-validator.pem` is
    downloaded and accessible by the current user.
2.  Make sure your client.rb points to the location of your validator
    pem.

### Commit or stash your changes

This isn't really an error, but can be confusing to new users. When you
try to install a cookbook with changes that have not been committed to
git you will get this error:

```bash
Installing getting-started to /home/jes/chef-repo/.chef/../cookbooks
ERROR: You have uncommitted changes to your cookbook repo:
 M cookbooks/getting-started/recipes/default.rb
 ?? .chef/
 ?? log
Commit or stash your changes before importing cookbooks
```

**Troubleshooting Steps**

Solve this by committing the cookbook changes. For example, the
following command would commit all new changes with the message
"updates".

```bash
git commit -am "Updating so I can install a site cookbook"
```

Re-run the `knife supermarket install` subcommand again to install the
community cookbook.

### Cannot find config file

If you're seeing an error like:

```bash
WARN: *****************************************
WARN: Can not find config file: /etc/chef/client.rb, using defaults.
WARN: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/client.rb
# ... output truncated ... #
FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::PrivateKeyMissing: I cannot read /etc/chef/validation.pem, which you told me to use to sign requests!
```

**Troubleshooting Steps**

Work around this issue by supplying the full path to the client.rb file:

```bash
chef-client -c /etc/chef/client.rb
```

### Pivotal.rb does not exist

If you're seeing an error like:

```bash
ERROR: CONFIGURATION ERROR:Specified config file /etc/opscode/pivotal.rb does not exist
```

**Troubleshooting Steps**

Run the following to restart all of the services:

> ```bash
> chef-server-ctl reconfigure
> ```

Because the Chef Infra Server is composed of many different services
that work together to create a functioning system, this step may take a
few minutes to complete.

## External PostgreSQL

The following error messages may be present when configuring the Chef
Infra Server to use a remote PostgreSQL server.

### CSPG001 (changed setting)

**Reason**

The value of `postgresql['external']` has been changed.

**Possible Causes**

-   This setting must be set before running
    `chef-server-ctl reconfigure`, and may not be changed after

{{< warning >}}

Upgrading is not supported at this time.

{{< /warning >}}

**Resolution**

-   Back up the data using `knife ec backup`, create a new backend
    instance, and then restore the data
-   Re-point front end machines at the new backend instance **or**
    assign the new backend instance the name/VIP of the old backend
    instance (including certificates, keys, and so on)

### CSPG010 (cannot connect)

**Reason**

Cannot connect to PostgreSQL on the remote server.

**Possible Causes**

-   PostgreSQL is not running on the remote server
-   The port used by PostgreSQL is blocked by a firewall on the remote
    server
-   Network routing configuration is preventing access to the host
-   When using Amazon Web Services (AWS), rules for security groups are
    preventing the Chef Infra Server from communicating with PostgreSQL

### CSPG011 (cannot authenticate)

**Reason**

Cannot authenticate to PostgreSQL on the remote server.

**Possible Causes**

-   Incorrect password specified for `db_superuser_password`
-   Incorrect user name specified for `db_superuser`

### CSPG012 (incorrect rules)

**Reason**

Cannot connect to PostgreSQL on the remote server because rules in
`pg_hba` are incorrect.

**Possible Causes**

-   There is no `pg_hba.conf` rule for the `db_superuser` in PostgreSQL
-   A rule exists for the `db_superuser` in `pg_hba.conf`, but it does
    not specify `md5` access
-   A rule in `pg_hba.conf` specifies an incorrect originating address

**Resolution**

-   Entries in the `pg_hba.conf` file should allow all user names that
    originate from any Chef Infra Server instance using `md5`
    authentication. For example, a `pg_hba.conf` entry for a valid
    username and password from the 192.0.2.0 subnet:

    ```bash
    host     postgres     all     192.0.2.0/24     md5
    ```

    or, specific named users with a valid password originating from the
    192.0.2.0 subnet. A file named `$PGDATA/chef_users` with the
    following content must be created:

    ```bash
    opscode_chef
    opscode_chef_ro
    bifrost
    bifrost_ro
    oc_id
    oc_id_ro
    ```

    where `CHEF-SUPERUSER-NAME` is replaced with the same user name
    specified by `postgresql['db_superuser']`. The corresponding
    `pg_hba.conf` entry is similar to:

    ```bash
    host     postgres     @chef_users     192.168.93.0/24     md5
    ```

    or, using the same `$PGDATA/chef_users` file (from the previous
    example), the following example shows a way to limit connections to
    specific nodes that are running components of the Chef Infra Server.
    This approach requires more maintenance because the `pg_hba.conf`
    file must be updated when machines are added to or removed from the
    Chef Infra Server configuration. For example, a high availability
    configuration with four nodes: `backend-1` (192.0.2.100),
    `backend-2` (192.0.2.101), `frontend-1` (192.0.2.110), and
    `frontend-2` (192.0.2.111).

    The corresponding `pg_hba.conf` entry is similar to:

    ```bash
    host     postgres     @chef_users     192.0.2.100     md5
    host     postgres     @chef_users     192.0.2.101     md5
    host     postgres     @chef_users     192.0.2.110     md5
    host     postgres     @chef_users     192.0.2.111     md5
    ```

    These changes also require a configuration reload for PostgreSQL:

    ```bash
    pg_ctl reload
    ```

    or:

    ```bash
    SELECT pg_reload_conf();
    ```

-   Rules in the `pg_hba.conf` file should allow only specific
    application names: `$db_superuser` (the configured superuser name in
    the chef-server.rb file), `oc_id`, `oc_id_ro`, `opscode_chef`,
    `opscode_chef_ro`, `bifrost`, and `bifrost_ro`

### CSPG013 (incorrect permissions)

**Reason**

The `db_superuser` account has incorrect permissions.

**Possible Causes**

-   The `db_superuser` account has not been granted `SUPERUSER` access

-   The `db_superuser` account has not been granted `CREATE DATABASE`
    and `CREATE ROLE` privileges

    ```bash
    ALTER ROLE "$your_db_superuser_name" WITH SUPERUSER
    ```

    or:

    ```bash
    ALTER ROLE "$your_db_superuser_name"  WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE
    ```

### CSPG014 (incorrect version)

**Reason**

Bad version of PostgreSQL.

**Possible Causes**

-   The remote server is not running PostgreSQL version 9.2.x

### CSPG015 (missing database)

**Reason**

The database template `template1` does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

-   The `template1` database template has been removed from the remote
    server

**Resolution**

-   Run the following command (as a superuser):

    ```bash
    CREATE DATABASE template1 TEMPLATE template0
    ```

    or:

    ```bash
    createdb -T template0 template1
    ```

### CSPG016 (database exists)

**Reason**

One (or more) of the PostgreSQL databases already exists.

**Possible Causes**

-   The `opscode_chef`, `oc_id`, and/or `bifrost` databases already
    exist on the remote machine
-   The PostgreSQL database exists for another application

**Resolution**

-   Verify that the `opscode_chef`, `oc_id`, and/or `bifrost` databases
    exist, and then verify that they are not being used by another
    internal application
-   Back up the PostgreSQL data, remove the existing databases, and
    reconfigure the Chef server

### CSPG017 (user exists)

**Reason**

One (or more) of the PostgreSQL predefined users already exists.

**Possible Causes**

-   The `opscode_chef`, `ospcode_chef_ro`, `bifrost`, `bifrost_ro`,
    `oc_id`, or `oc_id_ro` users already exist on the remote machine
-   The `postgresql['vip']` setting is configured to a remote host, but
    `postgresql['external']` is not set to `true`, which causes the
    `opscode_chef` and `ospcode_chef_ro` users to be created before the
    machine is reconfigured, which will return a permissions error
-   Existing, valid naming conflicts are present, where the users were
    created independently of the Chef server

**Resolution**

-   Run the following, if it is safe to do so, to update the user name
    that is specified in the error message:

    ```bash
    DROP ROLE "name-of-user";
    ```

    or change the name of the user by updating following settings in the
    chef-server.rb configuration file:

    ```none
    oc_id['sql_user'] = 'alternative_username'
    oc_id['sql_ro_user'] = alternative_username_for_ro_access'
    opscode_erchef['sql_user'] = 'alternative_username'
    opscode_erchef['sql_ro_user'] = 'alternative_username_for_ro_access'
    oc_bifrost['sql_ro_user'] = 'alternative_username'
    oc_bifrost['sql_ro_user'] = 'alternative_username_for_ro_access'
    ```
