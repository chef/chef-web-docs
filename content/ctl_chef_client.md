Options
=======

This command has the following syntax:

``` bash
chef-client OPTION VALUE OPTION VALUE ...
```

This command has the following options:

`-A`, `--fatal-windows-admin-check`

:   Cause a Chef Infra Client run to fail when the Chef Infra Client
    does not have administrator privileges in Microsoft Windows.

`-c CONFIG`, `--config CONFIG`

:   The configuration file to use.

`--config-option OPTION`

:   Overrides a single configuration option. Can be used to override
    multiple configuration options by adding another
    `--config-option OPTION`.

    ``` ruby
    property :db_password, String, sensitive: true
    ```

`--chef-zero-host HOST`

:   The host on which chef-zero is started.

`--chef-zero-port PORT`

:   The port on which chef-zero listens. If a port is not
    specified---individually, as range of ports, or from the
    `chef_zero.port` setting in the client.rb file---the Chef Infra
    Client will scan for ports between 8889-9999 and will pick the first
    port that is available.

    Changed in Chef Client 12.0 to support specifying a range of ports.

`-d SECONDS`, `--daemonize SECONDS`

:   Run the executable as a daemon. Use `SECONDS` to specify the number
    of seconds to wait before the first daemonized Chef Infra Client
    run. `SECONDS` is set to `0` by default.

    This option is only available on machines that run in UNIX or Linux
    environments. For machines that are running Microsoft Windows that
    require similar functionality, use the `chef-client::service` recipe
    in the `chef-client` cookbook:
    <https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-client>. This will
    install a Chef Infra Client service under Microsoft Windows using
    the Windows Service Wrapper.

`--delete-entire-chef-repo`

:   This option deletes an entire repository. This option may only be
    used when running the Chef Infra Client in local mode,
    (`--local-mode`). This option requires `--recipe-url` to be
    specified.

`--disable-config`

:   Use to run the Chef Infra Client using default settings. This will
    prevent the normally-associated configuration file from being used.
    This setting should only be used for testing purposes and should
    never be used in a production setting.

`-E ENVIRONMENT_NAME`, `--environment ENVIRONMENT_NAME`

:   The name of the environment.

`-f`, `--[no-]fork`

:   Contain Chef Infra Client runs in a secondary process with dedicated
    RAM. When a Chef Infra Client run is complete, the RAM is returned
    to the master process. This option helps ensure that a Chef Infra
    Client uses a steady amount of RAM over time because the master
    process does not run recipes. This option also helps prevent memory
    leaks such as those that can be introduced by the code contained
    within a poorly designed cookbook. Use `--no-fork` to disable
    running Chef Infra Client in fork node. Default value: `--fork`.

    Changed in Chef Client 12.0, unforked interval runs are no longer
    allowed.

`-F FORMAT`, `--format FORMAT`

:   {{% ctl_chef_client_options_format %}}

`--force-formatter`

:   Show formatter output instead of logger output.

`--force-logger`

:   Show logger output instead of formatter output.

`-g GROUP`, `--group GROUP`

:   The name of the group that owns a process. This is required when
    starting any executable as a daemon.

`-h`, `--help`

:   Show help for the command.

`-i SECONDS`, `--interval SECONDS`

:   The frequency (in seconds) at which Chef Infra Client runs. When
    running Chef Infra Client at intervals, apply `--splay` and
    `--interval` values before a Chef Infra Client run. Default value:
    `1800`.

`-j PATH`, `--json-attributes PATH`

:   The path to a file that contains JSON data. Used to setup the first
    client run. The attributes will persist on the Chef Infra Server for
    all future runs with option `-j`.

    **Run-lists**

    {{< shortcode_indent shortcode="node_ctl_run_list" >}}

    **Environments**

    Use this option to set the `chef_environment` value for a node.

    {{< note spaces=4 >}}

    Any environment specified for `chef_environment` by a JSON file will
    take precedence over an environment specified by the `--environment`
    option when both options are part of the same command.

    {{< /note >}}

    For example, run the following:

    ``` bash
    chef-client -j /path/to/file.json
    ```

    where `/path/to/file.json` is similar to:

    ``` javascript
    {
      "chef_environment": "pre-production"
    }
    ```

    This will set the environment for the node to `pre-production`.

    **All attributes are normal attributes**

    {{< shortcode_indent shortcode="node_ctl_attribute" >}}

    {{< note spaces=4 >}}

    This has set the `normal` attribute
    `node['override_attributes']['apptastic']`.

    {{< /note >}}

    **Specify a policy**

    Use this option to use policy files by specifying a JSON file that
    contains the following settings:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 40%" />
    <col style="width: 60%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><code>policy_group</code></td>
    <td>The name of a policy group that exists on the Chef Infra Server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><code>policy_name</code></td>
    <td>The name of a policy, as identified by the <code>name</code> setting in a Policyfile.rb file.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    For example:

    ``` javascript
    {
      "policy_name": "appserver",
      "policy_group": "staging"
    }
    ```

`-k KEY_FILE`, `--client_key KEY_FILE`

:   The location of the file that contains the client key. Default
    value: `/etc/chef/client.pem`.

`-K KEY_FILE`, `--validation_key KEY_FILE`

:   The location of the file that contains the key used when a Chef
    Infra Client is registered with a Chef Infra Server. A validation
    key is signed using the `validation_client_name` for authentication.
    Default value: `/etc/chef/validation.pem`.

`-l LEVEL`, `--log_level LEVEL`

:   The level of logging to be stored in a log file. Possible levels:
    `auto` (default), `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`.
    Default value: `warn` (when a terminal is available) or `info` (when
    a terminal is not available).

`-L LOGLOCATION`, `--logfile LOGLOCATION`

:   The location of the log file. This is recommended when starting any
    executable as a daemon. Default value: `STDOUT`.

`--lockfile LOCATION`

:   Use to specify the location of the lock file, which prevents
    multiple Chef Infra Client processes from converging at the same
    time.

`--minimal-ohai`

:   Run the Ohai plugins for name detection and resource/provider
    selection and no other Ohai plugins. Set to `true` during
    integration testing to speed up test cycles.

`--[no-]color`

:   View colored output. Default setting: `--color`.

`--[no-]fips`

:   Allows OpenSSL to enforce FIPS-validated security during a Chef
    Infra Client run.

`--[no-]skip-cookbook-sync`

:   Use cached cookbooks without overwriting local differences from the
    server. Use with caution. Useful for patching a set of cookbooks on
    a machine when iterating during development.

`--[no-]listen`

:   Run chef-zero in socketless mode. **This is the default behavior on
    Chef Client 13.1 and above.**

`-n NAME`, `--named-run-list NAME`

:   The run-list associated with a policy file.

`-N NODE_NAME`, `--node-name NODE_NAME`

:   The name of the node.

`-o RUN_LIST_ITEM`, `--override-runlist RUN_LIST_ITEM`

:   Replace the current run-list with the specified items. This option
    will not clear the list of cookbooks (and related files) that is
    cached on the node. This option will not persist node data at the
    end of the client run.

`--once`

:   Make only one Chef Infra Client run and cancel `interval` and
    `splay` options.

`-P PID_FILE`, `--pid PID_FILE`

:   The location in which a process identification number (pid) is
    saved. An executable, when started as a daemon, writes the pid to
    the specified file. Default value: `/tmp/name-of-executable.pid`.

`--profile-ruby`

:   Use the `--profile-ruby` option to dump a (large) profiling graph
    into `/var/chef/cache/graph_profile.out`. Use the graph output to
    help identify, and then resolve performance bottlenecks in a Chef
    Infra Client run. This option:

    -   Generates a large amount of data about a Chef Infra Client run.
    -   Has a dependency on the `ruby-prof` gem, which is packaged as
        part of Chef and Chef Workstation.
    -   Increases the amount of time required to complete a Chef Infra
        Client run.
    -   Should not be used in a production environment.

`-r RUN_LIST_ITEM`, `--runlist RUN_LIST_ITEM`

:   Permanently replace the current run-list with the specified run-list
    items.

`-R`, `--enable-reporting`

:   Enable Reporting, which performs data collection during a Chef Infra
    Client run.

`RECIPE_FILE`

:   The path to a recipe. For example, if a recipe file is in the
    current directory, use `recipe_file.rb`. This is typically used with
    the `--local-mode` option.

`--recipe-url=RECIPE_URL`

:   The location of a recipe when it exists at a URL. Use this option
    only when running Chef Infra Client with the `--local-mode` option.

`--run-lock-timeout SECONDS`

:   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a Chef Infra Client lock
    file to be deleted. Default value: not set (indefinite). Set to `0`
    to cause a second Chef Infra Client to exit immediately.

`-s SECONDS`, `--splay SECONDS`

:   A random number between zero and `splay` that is added to
    `interval`. Use splay to help balance the load on the Chef Infra
    Server by ensuring that many Chef Infra Client runs are not
    occurring at the same interval. When running Chef Infra Client at
    intervals, apply `--splay` and `--interval` values before a Chef
    Infra Client run.

    Changed in Chef Client 12.0 to be applied before the Chef Client
    run.

`-S CHEF_SERVER_URL`, `--server CHEF_SERVER_URL`

:   The URL for the Chef Infra Server.

`-u USER`, `--user USER`

:   The user that owns a process. This is required when starting any
    executable as a daemon.

`-v`, `--version`

:   The Chef Infra Client version.

`-W`, `--why-run`

:   Run the executable in why-run mode, which is a type of Chef Infra
    Client run that does everything except modify the system. Use
    why-run mode to understand why the Chef Infra Client makes the
    decisions that it makes and to learn more about the current and
    proposed state of the system.

`-z`, `--local-mode`

:   Run the Chef Infra Client in local mode. This allows all commands
    that work against the Chef Infra Server to also work against the
    local chef-repo.

Chef Infra Client Lock File
---------------------------

The Chef Infra Client uses a lock file to ensure that only one Chef
Infra Client run is in progress at any time. A lock file is created at
the start of a Chef Infra Client run and is deleted at the end of a Chef
Infra Client run. A new Chef Infra Client run looks for the presence of
a lock file and, if present, will wait for that lock file to be deleted.
The location of the lock file can vary by platform.

-   Use the `lockfile` setting in the client.rb file to specify
    non-default locations for the lock file. (The default location is
    typically platform-dependent and is recommended.)
-   Use the `run_lock_timeout` setting in the client.rb file to specify
    the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the lock file associated
    with an in-progress Chef Infra Client run to be deleted.

Run in Local Mode
=================

Local mode is a way to run the Chef Infra Client against the chef-repo
on a local machine as if it were running against the Chef Infra Server.
Local mode relies on chef-zero, which acts as a very lightweight
instance of the Chef Infra Server. chef-zero reads and writes to the
`chef_repo_path`, which allows all commands that normally work against
the Chef Infra Server to be used against the local chef-repo.

Local mode does not require a configuration file, instead it will look
for a directory named `/cookbooks` and will set `chef_repo_path` to be
just above that. (Local mode will honor the settings in a configuration
file, if desired.) If the client.rb file is not found and no
configuration file is specified, local mode will search for a config.rb
file.

Local mode will store temporary and cache files under the
`<chef_repo_path>/.cache` directory by default. This allows a normal
user to run the Chef Infra Client in local mode without requiring root
access.

About why-run Mode
------------------

why-run mode is a way to see what Chef Infra Client would have
configured, had an actual Chef Infra Client run occurred. This approach
is similar to the concept of "no-operation" (or "no-op"): decide what
should be done, but then don't actually do anything until it's done
right. This approach to configuration management can help identify where
complexity exists in the system, where inter-dependencies may be
located, and to verify that everything will be configured in the desired
manner.

When why-run mode is enabled, a Chef Infra Client run will occur that
does everything up to the point at which configuration would normally
occur. This includes getting the configuration data, authenticating to
the Chef Infra Server, rebuilding the node object, expanding the
run-list, getting the necessary cookbook files, resetting node
attributes, identifying the resources, and building the resource
collection, but does not include mapping each resource to a provider or
configuring any part of the system.

{{< note >}}

why-run mode is not a replacement for running cookbooks in a test
environment that mirrors the production environment. Chef uses why-run
mode to learn more about what is going on, but also Kitchen on developer
systems, along with an internal OpenStack cloud and external cloud
providers to test more thoroughly.

{{< /note >}}

When Chef Infra Client is run in why-run mode, certain assumptions are
made:

-   If the **service** resource cannot find the appropriate command to
    verify the status of a service, why-run mode will assume that the
    command would have been installed by a previous resource and that
    the service would not be running.
-   For `not_if` and `only_if` properties, why-run mode will assume
    these are commands or blocks that are safe to run. These conditions
    are not designed to be used to change the state of the system, but
    rather to help facilitate idempotency for the resource itself. That
    said, it may be possible that these attributes are being used in a
    way that modifies the system state
-   The closer the current state of the system is to the desired state,
    the more useful why-run mode will be. For example, if a full
    run-list is run against a fresh system, that run-list may not be
    completely correct on the first try, but also that run-list will
    produce more output than a smaller run-list

For example, the **service** resource can be used to start a service. If
the action is `:start`, then the service will start if it isn't running
and do nothing if it is running. If a service is installed from a
package, then Chef Infra Client cannot check to see if the service is
running until after the package is installed. In that case, why-run mode
will indicate what Chef Infra Client would do about the state of the
service after installing a package. This is important because service
actions often trigger notifications to other resources, so it is
important to know that these notifications are triggered correctly.

About chef-zero
---------------

chef-zero is a very lightweight Chef Infra Server that runs in-memory on
the local machine. This allows the Chef Infra Client to be run against
the chef-repo as if it were running against the Chef Infra Server.
chef-zero was [originally a standalone
tool](https://github.com/chef/chef-zero); it is enabled from within the
Chef Infra Client by using the `--local-mode` option. chef-zero is very
useful for quickly testing and validating the behavior of the Chef Infra
Client, cookbooks, recipes, and run-lists before uploading that data to
the actual Chef Infra Server.

{{< note >}}

chef-zero does not save data between restarts. Because it is intended to
be used locally, chef-zero does not perform input validation,
authentication, or authorization, as these security measures are not
necessary for local testing. For these reasons, we strongly recommend
against using chef-zero as a persistent Chef Infra Server.

{{< /note >}}

Changed in Chef Client 12.8, now chef-zero supports all Chef Server API
version 12 endpoints, except `/universe`.

Use Encrypted Data Bags
-----------------------

{{% data_bag %}}

**Create an encrypted data bag for use with Chef Infra Client local
mode**

{{% knife_data_bag_from_file_create_encrypted_local_mode %}}

Run in FIPS Mode
================

{{% fips_intro_client %}}

**Bootstrap a node using FIPS**

{{% knife_bootstrap_node_fips %}}

Run as a Service
================

The Chef Infra Client can be run as a daemon. Use the **Chef Infra
Client** cookbook to configure the Chef Infra Client as a daemon. Add
the `default` recipe to a node's run-list, and then use attributes in
that cookbook to configure the behavior of the Chef Infra Client. For
more information about these configuration options, see the [Chef Infra
Client cookbook repository on
github](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client/).

When the Chef Infra Client is run as a daemon, the following signals may
be used:

`HUP`

:   Use to reconfigure the Chef Infra Client.

`INT`

:   Use to terminate immediately without waiting for the current Chef
    Infra Client run to finish.

`QUIT`

:   Use to dump a stack trace, and continue to run.

`TERM`

:   Use to terminate but wait for the current Chef Infra Client run to
    finish, and then exit.

`USR1`

:   Use to wake up sleeping Chef Infra Client and trigger node
    convergence.

On Microsoft Windows, both the `HUP` and `QUIT` signals are not
supported.

Run with Elevated Privileges
============================

{{% ctl_chef_client_elevated_privileges %}}

Linux
-----

On Linux, the following error sometimes occurs when the permissions used
to run the Chef Infra Client are incorrect:

``` bash
chef-client
[Tue, 29 Nov 2015 19:46:17 -0800] INFO: *** Chef 12.X.X ***
[Tue, 29 Nov 2015 19:46:18 -0800] WARN: Failed to read the private key /etc/chef/client.pem: #<Errno::EACCES: Permission denied - /etc/chef/client.pem>
```

This can be resolved by running the command as root. There are a few
ways this can be done:

-   Log in as root and then run the Chef Infra Client

-   Use `su` to become the root user, and then run the Chef Infra
    Client. For example:

    ``` bash
    su
    ```

    and then:

    ``` bash
    # chef-client
    ```

-   Use the sudo utility

    ``` bash
    sudo chef-client
    ```

-   Give a user access to read `/etc/chef` and also the files accessed
    by the Chef Infra Client. This requires super user privileges and,
    as such, is not a recommended approach

Windows
-------

{{% ctl_chef_client_elevated_privileges_windows %}}

Run as Non-root User
====================

In large, distributed organizations the ability to modify the
configuration of systems is sometimes segmented across teams, often with
varying levels of access to those systems. For example, core application
services may be deployed to systems by a central server provisioning
team, and then developers on different teams build tooling to support
specific applications. In this situation, a developer only requires
limited access to machines and only needs to perform the operations that
are necessary to deploy tooling for a specific application.

The default configuration of the Chef Infra Client assumes that it is
run as the root user. This affords the Chef Infra Client the greatest
flexibility when managing the state of any object. However, the Chef
Infra Client may be run as a non-root user---i.e. "run as a user with
limited system privileges"---which can be useful when the objects on the
system are available to other user accounts.

When the Chef Infra Client is run as a non-root user the Chef Infra
Client can perform any action allowed to that user, as long as that
action does not also require elevated privileges (such as sudo or
pbrun). Attempts to manage any object that requires elevated privileges
will result in an error. For example, when the Chef Infra Client is run
as a non-root user that is unable to create or modify users, the
**user** resource will not work.

Set the Cache Path
------------------

To run a Chef Infra Client in non-root mode, add the `file_cache_path`
setting to the client.rb file for the node that will run as the non-root
user. Set the value of `file_cache_path` to be the home directory for
the user that is running the Chef Infra Client. For example:

``` ruby
file_cache_path "~/.chef/cache"
```

or:

``` ruby
file_cache_path File.join(File.expand_path("~"), ".chef", "cache")
```

{{< note >}}

When running the Chef Infra Client using the `--local-mode` option,
`~/.chef/local-mode-cache` is the default value for `file_cache_path`.

{{< /note >}}

Elevate Commands
----------------

Another example of running the Chef Infra Client as a non-root user
involves using resources to pass sudo commands as as an attribute on the
resource. For example, the **service** resource uses a series of
`_command` attributes (like `start_command`, `stop_command`, and so on),
the **package**-based resources use the `options` attribute, and the
**script**-based resources use the `code` attribute.

A command can be elevated similar to the following:

``` ruby
service 'apache2' do
  start_command 'sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start'
  action :start
end
```

This approach can work very well on a case-by-case basis. The challenge
with this approach is often around managing the size of the
`/etc/sudoers` file.

Run on IBM AIX
==============

The Chef Infra Client may now be used to configure nodes that are
running on the AIX platform, versions 7.1 (TL5 SP2 or higher,
recommended) and 7.2. The **service** resource supports starting,
stopping, and restarting services that are managed by System Resource
Controller (SRC), as well as managing all service states with BSD-based
init systems.

**System Requirements**

The Chef Infra Client has the [same system
requirements](/chef_system_requirements/#chef-infra-client) on the
AIX platform as any other platform, with the following notes:

-   Expand the file system on the AIX platform using `chfs` or by
    passing the `-X` flag to `installp` to automatically expand the
    logical partition (LPAR)
-   The EN_US (UTF-8) character set should be installed on the logical
    partition prior to installing the Chef Infra Client

**Install the Chef Infra Client on the AIX platform**

The Chef Infra Client is distributed as a Backup File Format (BFF)
binary and is installed on the AIX platform using the following command
run as a root user:

``` text
# installp -aYgd chef-12.0.0-1.powerpc.bff all
```

**Increase system process limits**

The out-of-the-box system process limits for maximum process memory size
(RSS) and number of open files are typically too low to run the Chef
Infra Client on a logical partition (LPAR). When the system process
limits are too low, the Chef Infra Client will not be able to create
threads. To increase the system process limits:

1.  Validate that the system process limits have not already been
    increased.

2.  If they have not been increased, run the following commands as a
    root user:

    ``` bash
    chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s default -a "rss=-1"
    ```

    and then:

    ``` bash
    chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s default -a "data=-1"
    ```

    and then:

    ``` bash
    chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s default -a "nofiles=50000"
    ```

    {{< note spaces="4" >}}

    The previous commands may be run against the root user, instead of
    default. For example:

    ``` bash
    chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s root_user -a "rss=-1"
    ```

    {{< /note >}}

3.  Reboot the logical partition (LPAR) to apply the updated system
    process limits.

When the system process limits are too low, an error is returned similar
to:

``` none
Error Syncing Cookbooks:
==================================================================

Unexpected Error:
-----------------
ThreadError: can't create Thread: Resource temporarily unavailable
```

**Install the UTF-8 character set**

The Chef Infra Client uses the EN_US (UTF-8) character set. By default,
the AIX base operating system does not include the EN_US (UTF-8)
character set and it must be installed prior to installing the Chef
Infra Client. The EN_US (UTF-8) character set may be installed from the
first disc in the AIX media or may be copied from
`/installp/ppc/*EN_US*` to a location on the logical partition (LPAR).
This topic assumes this location to be `/tmp/rte`.

Use `smit` to install the EN_US (UTF-8) character set. This ensures
that any workload partitions (WPARs) also have UTF-8 applied.

Remember to point `INPUT device/directory` to `/tmp/rte` when not
installing from CD.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Chef::Provider::Service::Aix</code></td>
<td><code>service</code></td>
<td>The provider that is used with the AIX platforms. Use the <code>service</code> short name to start, stop, and restart services with System Resource Controller (SRC).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Chef::Provider::Service::AixInit</code></td>
<td><code>service</code></td>
<td>The provider that is used to manage BSD-based init services on AIX.</td>

Configuring a Proxy Server
==========================

See the [proxies](/proxies/) documentation for information on how to
configure Chef Infra Client to use a proxy server.

Examples
========

**Run the Chef Infra Client**

``` bash
sudo chef-client
```

**Start a run when the Chef Infra Client is running as a daemon**

A Chef Infra Client that is running as a daemon can be woken up and
started by sending the process a `SIGUSR1`. For example, to trigger a
Chef Infra Client run on a machine running Linux:

``` bash
sudo killall -USR1 chef-client
```

**Setting the initial run-list using a JSON file**

{{% ctl_chef_client_bootstrap_initial_run_list %}}
