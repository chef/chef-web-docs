## Chef Manage

To uninstall the Chef management console, do the following:

1.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    chef-manage-ctl cleanse
    ```

2.  Use the package manager for the platform on which the Chef
    management console is installed, and then uninstall the package
    named `chef-manage`.

This package used to be named `opscode-manage` and the command line tool
used to be named `opscode-manage-ctl`.

## Chef Analytics

The `uninstall` subcommand is used to remove the Chef Analytics
application, but without removing any of the data. This subcommand will
shut down all services (including the `runit` process supervisor).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

```bash
opscode-analytics-ctl uninstall
```

{{< note >}}

To revert the `uninstall` subcommand, run the `reconfigure` subcommand
(because the `start` subcommand is disabled by the `uninstall` command).

## Reporting

Chef Infra Server, but without removing any of the data. This subcommand
will shut down all services (including the `runit` process supervisor).

This subcommand has the following syntax:

```bash
opscode-reporting-ctl uninstall
```

To revert the `uninstall` subcommand, run the `reconfigure` subcommand
