About Azure Testdrive

The Azure Testdrive Marketplace image deploys Chef Automate and Chef Infrastructure Server on a shared instance that can be used with [Chef Workstation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/) tools like `chef`, `knife`, `inspec` and `hab`. The Chef Automate stack provides the dashboard, data aggregation, and analytics layer for all Chef products.
