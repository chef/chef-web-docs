This topic covers migrating existing definitions to custom resources.
Custom resources are integral to the modern Chef Infra workflow. While
definitions are not yet deprecated, we *strongly* advise migrating to
custom resources immediately in order to benefit from the many features
of Chef Infra such as notifications, reporting, why-run mode, and
ChefSpec unit testing.

## Definitions

A definition behaved like a compile-time macro that was reusable across
recipes. A definition was typically created by wrapping arbitrary code
around Chef Infra resources that were declared as if they were in a
recipe. A definition was then used in one (or more) actual recipes as if
the definition were a resource.

Though a definition looks like a resource, and at first glance seems
like it could be used interchangeably, some important differences exist.
Definitions:

-   Are not true resources
-   Are processed when resource collection is compiled, not when a node
    is converged
-   Don't support common resource properties, such as `notifies`,
    `subscribes`, `only_if`, `not_if`, and `sensitive`
-   Don't support input validation in passed arguments, unlike a
    resource which supports validation with properties
-   Don't support `why-run` mode
-   Can't report to Chef Automate
-   Cannot be tested with ChefSpec
-   There are known issues with the definition parameters hash where certain names, `timeout` for example,
    will not work. These issues will not be fixed.

## Syntax

A definition had four components:

-   A resource name
-   Zero or more arguments that define parameters their default values;
    if a default value was not specified, it was assumed to be `nil`
-   A hash that could have been used within a definition's body to
    provide access to parameters and their values
-   The body of the definition

The basic syntax of a definition was:

```ruby
define :my_definition_name do
  body
end
```

More commonly, the usage incorporated arguments to the definition:

```ruby
define :my_definition_name, parameter: :argument, parameter: :argument do
  body(likely referencing the params hash)
end
```

The following simple example shows a definition with no arguments (a
parameterless macro in the truest sense):

```ruby
define :prime_myfile do
  file '/etc/myfile' do
    content 'some content'
  end
end
```

An example showing the use of parameters, with a parameter named `port`
that defaults to `4000` rendered into a **template** resource, would
look like:

```ruby
define :prime_myfile, port: 4000 do
   template '/etc/myfile' do
     source 'myfile.erb'
     variables({
       port: params[:port],
     })
   end
end
```

Or the following definition, which looks like a resource when used in a
recipe, but also contained **directory** and **file** resources that
were repeated, but with slightly different parameters:

```ruby
define :host_porter, port: 4000, hostname: nil do
  params[:hostname] ||= params[:name]

  directory '/etc/#{params[:hostname]}' do
    recursive true
  end

  file '/etc/#{params[:hostname]}/#{params[:port]}' do
    content 'some content'
  end
end
```

which was then used in a recipe like this:

```ruby
host_porter node['hostname'] do
  port 4000
end

host_porter 'www1' do
  port 4001
end
```

## Migrating to Custom Resources

We highly recommend migrating existing definitions to custom resources
to unlock the full feature set of Chef Infra resources. The following
example shows a definition and that same definition rewritten as a
custom resource.

### Initial Definition Code

The following definition processes unique hostnames and ports, passed on
as parameters:

```ruby
define :host_porter, port: 4000, hostname: nil do
  params[:hostname] ||= params[:name]

  directory '/etc/#{params[:hostname]}' do
    recursive true
  end

  file '/etc/#{params[:hostname]}/#{params[:port]}' do
    content 'some content'
  end
end
```

### Migrated to a Custom Resource

The definition is improved by rewriting it as a custom resource. This
uses properties to accept input and has a single `:create` action:

```ruby
property :port, Integer, default: 4000
property :hostname, String, name_property: true

action :create do
  directory "/etc/#{hostname}" do
    recursive true
  end

  file "/etc/#{hostname}/#{port}" do
    content 'some content'
  end
end
```

Once written, a custom resource may be used in a recipe just like any
resource that is built into Chef Infra. A custom resource gets its name
from the cookbook and the name of its file in the `/resources` directory
with an underscore (`_`) separating them. For example, a cookbook named
`host` with a custom resource file named `porter.rb` in the `/resources`
directory would be called `host_porter`. Use it in a recipe like this:

```ruby
host_porter node['hostname'] do
  port 4000
end
```

or:

```ruby
host_porter 'www1' do
  port 4001
end
```
