title = "Deprecation: Supports metaproperty (CHEF-8)"

The `user` resource previously allowed a cookbook author to set policy
for the resource in two ways. The `supports` metaproperty, which is now
deprecated, enabled the `manage_home` and `non_unique` properties to be
set.

The `supports` metaproperty was deprecated in Chef Client 12.14 and will
be removed in Chef Client 13.

## Example

```ruby
user 'betty' do
  supports({
    manage_home: true,
    non_unique: true,
  })
end
```

## Remediation

Make the `manage_home` and `non_unique` settings properties rather than
parts of the `supports` hash.

```ruby
user 'betty' do
  manage_home true
  non_unique true
end
```
