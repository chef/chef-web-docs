    Chef Workstation tools such as Test Kitchen which creates and
    manages virtualized test environments.

Chef Workstation App Requirements
---------------------------------

-   Windows: No additional requirements
-   Mac: No additional requirements
-   Linux: You must have a graphical window manager running with support
    for system tray icons.
    -   On some distributions you may need to install additional
        libraries. After you install the Chef Workstation package from
        the terminal, the post-install message will tell you which, if
        any, additional libraries are required to run the Chef
        Workstation App.

Installation
============

The Chef Workstation installer must run as a privileged user.

Chef Workstation installs to `/opt/chef-workstation/` on macOS / Linux
and `C:\opscode\chef-workstation\` on Windows. These file locations
should help avoid interference between these components and other
applications that may be running on the target machine.

macOS
-----

1.  Dependency: Xcode is recommended for running Chef Workstation on
    macOS. While Chef Workstation works without Xcode, it is required
    for native Ruby Gem installation. Run `xcode-select --install` from
    the terminal to install Xcode.
2.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation#mac_os_x) and
    select the appropriate package for your macOS version. Click on the
    **Download** button.
3.  Follow the steps to accept the license and install Chef Workstation.

Windows
-------

1.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation#windows) and select
    the appropriate package for your Windows version. Click on the
    **Download** button.
2.  Follow the steps to accept the license and install Chef Workstation.
    You will have the option to change your install location; by default
    the installer uses the `C:\opscode\chef-workstation\` directory.
3.  **Optional:** Set the default shell. On Microsoft Windows it is
    strongly recommended to use Windows PowerShell instead of `cmd.exe`.

Linux
-----

1.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation) and download the
    appropriate package for your distribution:

    ``` bash
    wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chefworkstation/0.14/ubuntu/18.04/chefworkstation_0.14.16-1_amd64.deb
    ```

2.  Use your distribution's package manager to install Chef Workstation:

    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

        ``` bash
        rpm -Uvh chef-workstation-0.14.16-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
        ```

    -   Debian/Ubuntu:

        ``` bash
        dpkg -i chefworkstation_0.14.16-1_amd64.deb
        ```

Verify the Installation
=======================

To verify the installation, run:

``` shell
chef -v
```

Which returns the versions of all installed Chef tools:

``` shell
Chef Workstation version: 0.16.31
Chef Infra Client version: 15.8.23
Chef InSpec version: 4.18.85
Chef CLI version: 2.0.0
Test Kitchen version: 2.3.4
Cookstyle version: 5.21.9
```

Workstation installation.
