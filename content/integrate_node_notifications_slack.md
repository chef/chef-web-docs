Chef Automate may be configured to notify a particular Slack channel or
user when it detects certain issues with the nodes you are managing.
Currently, those issues include:

-   A Chef Infra Client run failure on any node in your fleet.
-   A critical Chef InSpec compliance scan failure on any node in your
    fleet.

Integrating Chef Automate with Slack requires a webhook to be created in
Slack, and then saving that webhook in Chef Automate. Currently, any
user of Chef Automate may create and manage notifications. Notifications
sent to Slack by Chef Automate will respect any outbound proxy settings
that you may have configured in your <span
class="title-ref">delivery.rb</span> file. For more information on the
proxy settings in Chef Automate, see [Proxy
Settings](https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_delivery.html#proxy-settings).

{{< info >}}

Notifications sent to Slack by Chef Automate do not support retries;
therefore, notifications sent while Slack is experiencing API issues,
outages, or some other unplanned downtime may never be received by the
channel. Undelivered notifications are not re-sent. Attempts to send
notifications do generate log messages in your Chef Automate server.

    Automate.
2.  Select **Add Configuration**.
3.  Under **Post to Channel**, select the channel in Slack where Chef
    Automate will send notifications.
4.  Click **Add Incoming Webhooks Integration**. Slack will create the
    new webhook and then provide a webhook URL for you to copy.
5.  Copy the URL and click **Save Settings** at the bottom of the page
    to create the Slack webhook.

4.  Pick a meaningful name for the webhook, and then paste the Slack
    webhook URL from the previous section.
5.  Click **Send Test**. If a test notification is successful, click
