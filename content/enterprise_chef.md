The Enterprise edition of Progress Chef expands on the basic functionalities provided by the open-source version of Chef. It incorporates enhanced features and prompt and timely support. It is better tailored to address the demands of large and medium-sized enterprises, irrespective of the domain.

Some of the features and services provided in Enterprise Chef that are not present in the Community edition are as follows:

## Supply Chain Integrity of Distribution and SLOs

Enterprise Chef distributions have scrupulously verified bundled dependencies that often come with a signatory commitment of authenticity from Progress. Additionally, Enterprise Chef has Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for response and resolution time and any other distribution objectives.

## Public Company Security Standards for Customers

Enterprise Chef adheres to multiple compliance standards, such as SOC, PCI, DSS, ISO 90078 and more. Progress, a publicly traded company, reports identified CVEs promptly to Enterprise customers under responsible disclosure norms.

## SLA-based Services Provided to Enterprise Customers

Enterprise Customers have SLAs tied to incident response and security fixes on CVEs, including identification, notification, mitigation and resolution. The Chef Professional Services team provides SLA-backed technical support for proactive monitoring and maintenance. Premium customers are provided with Customer Success Managers or Account Managers for regular sync-ups and issue resolutions.

## Cyber Insurance & Indemnification

Progress has a comprehensive indemnification policy under our agreed Progress Chef EULA, which offers maximum protection to our customers. To understand our indemnification obligation for intellectual property infringement claims against you for using the product, exceptions and other options, please read section 10.1 of the Progress Chef EULA [here](https://www.chef.io/online-master-agreement).

## Progress Security Operation Centre (SOC) Support

Progress SOC verifies and manages compliance with its products, which includes a zero-trust cybersecurity architecture approach, compliance audits and verifications, source-code scanning, external penetration tests, third-party deep-dive code assessments and ongoing coordination with many of the industry’s top cybersecurity researchers who assess risk profiles and software exploits.

## Access to Chef Premium Content

Enterprise users of Chef are provided with [Chef Premium Content](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).

Chef Premium Content consists of ready-to-use 100+ curated content for compliance audits, remediation and desktop configuration based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) certified benchmarks or Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).

## Completely Managed Solution (SaaS)

[Chef SaaS](https://docs.chef.io/saas/) is a cloud-based, completely managed solution for infrastructure, compliance and cloud security automation across entire IT estates. It mirrors all capabilities available on the on-premises version.

## High Availability Deployment Option

Only enterprise customers have access to the high-availability version of Chef through [Chef Automate HA](https://docs.chef.io/automate/ha/) and Chef SaaS. Automate HA supports both on-premises deployment and AWS deployment. Opting for HA will help commercial users with large fleets avoid service and zone failure issues.

## Single Pane of Visibility with Progress® Chef ® Automate

[Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/automate/ha/) has a unified dashboard that provides a consolidated view of an organization's IT estate. It also provides a web-based administration facility, support for compliance, integration with third-party tools, and options for installation in high-availability mode.

## Job Orchestration and Node Management Capabilities

Progress® Chef® Courier™ is a job orchestration solution that helps you execute and verify Chef actions on any set or subset of nodes and schedule them for immediate, subsequent or period time intervals. Users can access the complete set of job orchestration features, including exceptions, job limits, reports, and notifications, through Chef Courier.

Node management is a feature that will allow users to have a Chef-guided system to perform node enrollment (server/VM/desktop/kiosk/network device/edge), manage skills and gain visibility/insights about nodes.

All information on Chef 360, which hosts Chef Courier, is provided [here](https://docs.chef.io/360/1.0/architecture/). Node Management capabilities are provided [here](https://docs.chef.io/360/1.0/get_started/node_requirements/).

## Support for Platforms

Enterprise Chef directly [supports 13 platforms](https://docs.chef.io/platforms/#commercial-support-4) commonly used by enterprises and indirectly supports another 18. Commercially supported platforms are extensively tested as part of the development and release process of Chef.

## Integrations

Enterprise Chef guarantees support for issues arising from embedded dependencies or third-party integrations. The commercial version of Chef Automate offers pre-formatted data for integration with other tools like monitoring platforms or ticketing systems. Enterprise Chef offers built-in metrics and APIs for easy access to infrastructure data.
