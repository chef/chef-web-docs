The Workflow DSL is a collection of helper methods that is used in
recipes as a way to enhance the Recipe DSL to collect data about:

-   Which testing tools---Foodcritic, Kitchen, ChefSpec, and so on---are
    present in a cookbook?
-   What types of delivery environments are available?
-   Have files been changed?
-   Do the changes made to a cookbook require a version change?
-   Should a cookbook should be pushed to the Chef Infra Server and/or
    to GitHub?

{{< warning >}}

These recipe helpers are available from the `delivery-truck` cookbook:
<https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/delivery-truck>. This cookbook is
a recommended dependency for any `build-cookbook` for a project that
publishes changes to a Chef Automate pipeline.

{{< /warning >}}

## Helpers

The following Chef Automate-specific helpers can be used in recipes:

`bumped_version?`

:   Determine if files in a cookbook have been modified, and then to
    ensure that a cookbook's version is updated in its metadata.rb file.
    The Verify phase will fail if files in a cookbook are modified
    without a corresponding version bump to the metadata.rb file.

`changed_cookbooks`

:   Get a list of cookbooks that have been modified.

`changed_files`

:   Get a list of files that have been modified.

`define_project_application`

:   Define a set of attributes that are used to pin versions as the
    project moves through stages in the Chef Automate pipeline.

`delivery_chef_server`

:   Return a Hash that contains details about how to talk to the Chef
    Infra Server.

`delivery_chef_server_search`

:   Run a search query against the node objects on the Chef Infra
    Server, using the default search query. The default search query is
    defined in the Chef Automate web UI on the "Default Search" tab.

`delivery_environment`

:   Get the name of the standard environment.

`deployment_search_query`

:   Get a custom search query from the `config.json` file. By default,
    the `deploy.rb` recipe triggers a Chef Infra Client run via Chef
    Push Jobs against all nodes that belong to the current environment
    in Chef Automate and have modified cookbooks in the run-list.

    If the `config.json` file specifies:

    ```javascript
    "delivery-truck": {
      "deploy": {
        "search": "SEARCH_QUERY"
      }
    }
    ```

    then the search is run against all node objects on the Chef Infra
    Server. For example:

    ```javascript
    "delivery-truck": {
      "deploy": {
        "search": "role:load_balancer"
      }
    }
    ```

`foodcritic_excludes`

:   Get a list of directories against which Foodcritic rules should not
    be run. This looks in the `config.json` file for the `foodcritic`
    block to see if the `excludes` setting has been specified.

    THIS IS A DTAG
    delivery_config_json_setting_delivery_truck_lint_foodcritic_excludes

`foodcritic_tags`

:   Get a list of Foodcritic tags (rule identifiers) to be run. This
    looks in the `config.json` file for the `foodcritic` block to see if
    the `only_rules` and/or `ignore_rules` settings have been specified.

    THIS IS A DTAG
    delivery_config_json_setting_delivery_truck_lint_foodcritic_ignore_rules

    THIS IS A DTAG
    delivery_config_json_setting_delivery_truck_lint_foodcritic_only_rules

`get_acceptance_environment`

:   Get the name of the acceptance environment.

`get_project_application`

:   Get attributes for a defined project application.

    {{< warning spaces =4 >}}

    If the `get_project_application` method is called from the
    `provision.rb` recipe, be sure that `delivery-truck::provision` is
    executed before `get_project_application` by putting it in a
    `ruby_block` or into a separate recipe that is called from
    `provision.rb` via `include_recipe`. If the
    `get_project_application` method is called directly in
    `provision.rb`:

    ```ruby
    include_recipe 'delivery-truck::provision'
    get_project_application(<project_app_name_string>)
    ```

    you will get an error because Chef Infra Client will execute
    `get_project_application` at compile time before it has run
    `include_recipe 'delivery-truck::provision'`. It is recommended to
    either use `get_project_application` in `deploy.rb`, a project
    cookbook, in a `ruby_block` or in a separate `include_recipe` that
    is executed after `include_recipe 'delivery-truck::provision'`.

    {{< /warning >}}

`get_project_secrets`

:   Get the contents of the `delivery-secrets` data bag from the Chef
    Infra Server. This data bag contains secrets that enable cookbooks
    to be published to a Chef Supermarket, an open source git
    repository, a repository on GitHub.

`has_kitchen_tests?`

:   Determine if a .kitchen.yml file exists in a cookbook.

`has_spec_tests?`

:   Determine if tests exist in the `/spec` directory in a cookbook.

`push_repo_to_git?`

:   Determine if a repo should be pushed to an open source git
    repository.

    THIS IS A DTAG
    delivery_config_json_setting_delivery_truck_publish_git

`push_repo_to_github?`

:   Determine if a repo should be pushed to GitHub.

    THIS IS A DTAG
    delivery_config_json_setting_delivery_truck_publish_github

`share_cookbook_to_supermarket?`

:   Determine if a repo should be pushed to an open source git
    repository.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use the Workflow DSL in a cookbook:

**changed_cookbooks**

```ruby
changed_cookbooks.each do |cookbook|
  execute "unit_rspec_#{cookbook[:name]}" do
    cwd cookbook[:path]
    command "rspec --format documentation --color"
    only_if { has_spec_tests?(cookbook[:path]) }
  end
end
```

**bumped_version?**

```ruby
changed_cookbooks.each do |cookbook|
  unless bumped_version?(cookbook[:path])
    raise DeliveryTruck::Error, "The #{cookbook[:name]} cookbook was modified " \
                                "but the version was not updated in the " \
                                "metadata file."
  end

  execute "syntax_check_#{cookbook[:name]}" do
    command "knife cookbook test -o #{cookbook[:path]} -a"
  end
end
```

**push_repo_to_github?**

```ruby
if push_repo_to_github?
  git_ssh = File.join(node['delivery']['workspace']['cache'], 'git_ssh')
  deploy_key = File.join(node['delivery']['workspace']['cache'], 'github.pem')
  secrets = get_project_secrets

  file deploy_key do
    content secrets['github']
    owner 'dbuild'
    mode '0600'
    sensitive true
  end

  template git_ssh do
    source 'git_ssh.erb'
    owner 'dbuild'
    mode '0755'
  end

  execute "set_git_username" do
    command "git config user.name 'Delivery'"
    cwd node['delivery']['workspace']['repo']
    environment({"GIT_SSH" => git_ssh})
  end

  execute "set_git_email" do
    command "git config user.email 'delivery@chef.io'"
    cwd node['delivery']['workspace']['repo']
    environment({"GIT_SSH" => git_ssh})
  end

  github_repo = node['delivery']['config']['delivery-truck']['publish']['github']
  execute "add_github_remote" do
    command "git remote add github git@github.com:#{github_repo}.git"
    cwd node['delivery']['workspace']['repo']
    environment({"GIT_SSH" => git_ssh})
    not_if "git remote --verbose | grep ^github"
  end

  execute "push_to_github" do
    command "git push github master"
