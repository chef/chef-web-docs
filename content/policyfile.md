Why Policyfile?
===============

For some users of Chef, Policyfile will make it easier to test and
promote code safely with a simpler interface. Policyfile improves the
user experience and resolves real-world problems that some workflows
built around Chef must deal with. The following sections discuss in more
detail some of the good reasons to use Policyfile, including:

-   Focus the workflow on the entire system
-   Safer development workflows
-   Less expensive computation
-   Code visibility
-   Role mutability
-   Cookbook mutability
-   Replaces Berkshelf and the environment cookbook pattern

Focused System Workflows
------------------------

The knife command line tool maps very closely to the Chef Infra Server
API and the objects defined by it: roles, environments, run-lists,
cookbooks, data bags, nodes, and so on. Chef Infra Client assembles
these pieces at run-time and configures a host to do useful work.

Policyfile focuses that workflow onto the entire system, rather than the
individual components. For example, Policyfile describes whole systems,
whereas each individual revision of the `Policyfile.lock.json` file
uploaded to the Chef Infra Server describes a part of that system,
inclusive of roles, environments, cookbooks, and the other Chef Infra
Server objects necessary to configure that part of the system.

Safer Workflows
---------------

Policyfile encourages safer workflows by making it easier to publish
development versions of cookbooks to the Chef Infra Server without the
risk of mutating the production versions and without requiring a
complicated versioning scheme to work around cookbook mutability issues.
Roles are mutable and those changes are applied only to the nodes
specified by the policy. Policyfile does not require any changes to your
normal workflows. Use the same repositories you are already using, the
same cookbooks, and workflows. Policyfile will prevent an updated
cookbook or role from being applied immediately to all machines.

Code Visibility
---------------

When running Chef without Policyfile, the exact set of cookbooks that
are applied to a node is defined by:

-   The node's `run_list` property
-   Any roles that are present in the node's run-list or recursively
    included by those roles
-   The environment, which may restrict the set of valid cookbook
    versions for a node based on a variety of constraint operators
-   Dependencies, as defined by each cookbook's metadata
-   Dependency resolution picks the "best" set of cookbooks that meet
    dependency and environment criteria

These conditions are re-evaluated every time Chef Infra Client runs,
which can make it harder to know which cookbooks will be run by Chef
Infra Client or what the effects of updating a role or uploading a new
cookbook will be.

Policyfile simplifies this behavior by computing the cookbook set on the
workstation, and then producing a readable document of that solution: a
`Policyfile.lock.json` file. This pre-computed file is uploaded to the
Chef Infra Server, and is then used in each Chef Infra Client run that
is managed by that particular policy name and policy group.

Less Expensive Computation
--------------------------

When running Chef without Policyfile, the Chef Infra Server loads
dependency data for all known versions of all known cookbooks, and then
runs an expensive computation to determine the correct set.

Policyfile moves this computation to the workstation, where it is done
less frequently.

Role and Environment Mutability
-------------------------------

When running Chef without Policyfile roles and environments are global
objects. Changes to roles and environments are applied immediately to
any node that contains that role in its run-list or belong to a
particular environment. This can make it hard to update roles and
environments and in some use cases discourages using them at all.

Policyfile effectively replaces roles and environments. Policyfile files
are versioned automatically and new versions are applied to systems only
when promoted.

Cookbook Mutability
-------------------

When running Chef without Policyfile, existing versions of cookbooks are
mutable. This is convenient for many use cases, especially if users
upload in-development cookbook revisions to the Chef Infra Server. But
this sometimes creates issues that are similar to role mutability by
allowing those cookbook changes to be applied immediately to nodes that
use that cookbook. Users account for this by rigorous testing processes
to ensure that only fully integrated cookbooks are ever published. This
process does enforce good development habits, but at the same time it
shouldn't be a required part of a workflow that ends with publishing an
in-development cookbook to the Chef Infra Server for testing against
real nodes.

Policyfile solves this issue by using a cookbook publishing API for the
Chef Infra Server that does not provide cookbook mutability. Name
collisions are prevented by storing cookbooks by name and an opaque
identifier that is computed from the content of the cookbook itself.

For example, name/version collisions can occur when users temporarily
fork an upstream cookbook. Even if the user contributes their change and
the maintainer is responsive, there may be a period of time where the
user needs their fork in order to make progress. This situation presents
a versioning dilemma: if the user doesn't update their own version, they
must overwrite the existing copy of that cookbook on the Chef Infra
Server, wheres if they do update the version number it might conflict
with the version number of the future release of that upstream cookbook.

### Opaque IDs

The opaque identifier that is computed from the content of a cookbook is
the only place where an opaque identifier is necessary. When working
with Policyfile, be sure to:

-   Use the same names and version constraints as normal in the
    `Policyfile.rb` file
-   Use the same references to cookbooks pulled from Chef Supermarket
-   Use the same branch, tag, and revision patterns for cookbooks pulled
    from git
-   Use the same paths for cookbooks pulled from disk

Extra metadata about the cookbook is stored and included in Chef Infra
Server API responses and in the `Policyfile.lock.json` file, including
the source of a cookbook (Chef Supermarket, git, local disk, etc.), as
well as any upstream idenfiers, such as git revisions. For cookbooks
that are loaded from the local disk that are in a git repo, the upstream
URL, current revision ID, and the state of the repo are stored also.

The opaque identifier is mostly behind the scenes and is only visible
once published to the Chef Infra Server. Cookbooks that are uploaded to
the Chef Infra Server may have extended version numbers such as
`1.0.0-dev`.

Environment Cookbooks
---------------------

Policyfile replaces the environment cookbook pattern that is often
required by Berkshelf, along with a dependency solver and fetcher. That
said, Policyfile does not replace all Berkshelf scenarios.

Knife Commands
==============

The following knife commands used to set the policy group and policy
name on the Chef Infra Server. For example:

``` bash
knife node policy set test-node 'test-policy-group-name' 'test-policy-name'
```

Policyfile.rb
=============

{{% policyfile_rb %}}

Syntax
------

{{% policyfile_rb_syntax %}}

Settings
--------

{{% policyfile_rb_settings %}}

Example
-------

{{% policyfile_rb_example %}}

client.rb Settings
==================

The following settings may be configured in the client.rb file for use
with Policyfile:

`named_run_list`

:   The run-list associated with a policy file.

`policy_group`

:   The name of a policy group that exists on the Chef Infra Server.
    `policy_name` must also be specified.

`policy_name`

:   The name of a policy, as identified by the `name` setting in a
    `Policyfile.rb` file. `policy_group` must also be specified.

`use_policyfile`

:   Chef Infra Client automatically checks the configuration, node JSON,
    and the stored node on the Chef Infra Server to determine if
    Policyfile files are being used, and then automatically updates this
    flag. Default value: `false`.

knife bootstrap
===============

A node may be bootstrapped to use Policyfile files. Use the following
options as part of the bootstrap command:

`--policy-group POLICY_GROUP`

:   The name of a policy group that exists on the Chef Infra Server.

`--policy-name POLICY_NAME`

:   The name of a policy, as identified by the `name` setting in a
    `Policyfile.rb` file.

For a customized bootstrap process, add `policy_name` and `policy_group`
to the first-boot JSON file that is passed to Chef Infra Client.

knife search
============

The `policy_name` and `policy_group` settings for a node are stored as
searchable attributes and as such are available when using a fuzzy
matching search pattern. For example: `knife search dev` will return
nodes that are part of the `dev` policy group.

Test w/Kitchen
==============

Kitchen may be used to test Policyfile files. Add the following to
kitchen.yml:

``` yaml
provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
```

A named run-list may be used on a per-suite basis:

``` yaml
suites:
  - name: client
    provisioner:
      named_run_list: test_client_recipe
  - name: server
    provisioner:
      named_run_list: test_server_recipe
```

or globally:

``` yaml
provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
  named_run_list: integration_test_run_list
```

or testing with policies per-suite, once the Policyfile files are
available in your repo:

``` yaml
suites:
   - name: defaultmega
      provisioner:
         policyfile: policies/default.rb
      attributes:
   - name: defaultultra
      provisioner:
         policyfile: policies/defaulttwo.rb
      attributes
```

{{< note >}}

As `chef_zero` explicitly tests outside the context of a Chef Infra
Server, the `policy_groups` concept is not applicable. The value of
`policy_group` during a converge will be set to `local`.
