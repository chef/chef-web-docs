This page provides guidance on using Chef product names.

## Chef product names

For Chef applications and components, use:

- Chef Automate
- Chef Backend
- Chef Habitat
- Chef Infra (formerly Chef)
- Chef Infra Client (Use Chef Client up to version 14.x)
- Chef Infra Server (Formerly Chef Server)
- Chef InSpec
- Chef Manage
- Supermarket

Always capitalize product names and never hyphenate a product name or refer to a product by its CLI command.

## Shorten product names

It is awkward to refer to the full product name all the time.
Use the full product name the first time it's used in a page or paragraph and then use the shortened product name afterward.

## Using _the_ before product names

Avoid using _the_ before a product name unless you're referring to a component of that product.
