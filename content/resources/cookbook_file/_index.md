      existing mode on the file is used. If `mode` is not specified, the

      file does not exist, and the `:create` action is specified, Chef

      Infra Client assumes a mask value of `''0777''` and then applies the

      umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the

      `mask` value. For example, if the umask on a system is `''022''`, Chef

      Infra Client uses the default value of `''0755''`.


      The behavior is different depending on the platform.


      UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that

      defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:

      `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted

      string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If

      the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the

      value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For

      example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,

      use `''0777''` or `''777''`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,

      use `01777` or `''1777''`.


      Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the

      octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows

      security. For example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. Values up to

      `''0777''` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft

      Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`

      equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This

      property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no

      effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both

      specified, the effects are cumulative.'
