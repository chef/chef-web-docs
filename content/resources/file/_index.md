  description_list:
  - markdown: 'A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the octal mode. For

      example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If `mode` is not specified

      and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is

      used. If `mode` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the

      `:create` action is specified, Chef Infra Client assumes a mask

      value of `''0777''` and then applies the umask for the system on which

      the file is to be created to the `mask` value. For example, if the

      umask on a system is `''022''`, Chef Infra Client uses the default

      value of `''0755''`.


      The behavior is different depending on the platform.


      UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that

      defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:

      `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted

      string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If

      the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the

      value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For

      example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,

      use `''0777''` or `''777''`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,

      use `01777` or `''1777''`.


      Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the

      octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows

      security. For example: `''755''`, `''0755''`, or `00755`. Values up to

      `''0777''` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft

      Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`

      equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This

      property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no

      effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both

      specified, the effects are cumulative.'

      The types for this property are a block or a string. When specified

      as a block, it returns `true` or `false`. When specified as a

      string, it is executed as a system command. It evaluates to `true`

      if the command returns 0 as its exit status code and `false` if the

      command returns a non-zero exit status code.'
  - note:
    - markdown: 'A block is arbitrary Ruby defined within the resource block by using

        the `verify` property. When a block returns `true`, Chef Infra

        Client will continue to update the file as appropriate.'
  - markdown: "For example, this should return `true`:\n\n``` ruby\nfile '/tmp/baz'\

      \ ruby\nfile '/etc/nginx.conf' do\n  verify 'nginx -t -c %{path}'\nend\n```\n\
      \nIn this example, the `%{path}` portion of this command is expanded\nto the\
      \ temporary location where a copy of the file to be created\nexists. This will\
      \ use Nginx's syntax checking feature to ensure the\nfile is a valid Nginx configuration\

      \ returns a non-zero exit\nstatus code.\n\nThis should return `true`:\n\n```\

      \ \"hello\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWhereas, this should return `false`:\n\n```\
