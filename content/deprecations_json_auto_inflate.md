Internally, the `Chef::REST` class attempts to guess which Chef class a
JSON document relates too, and then automatically turns the JSON in to
that class.

This deprecation warning was added in Chef Client 12.7.2, and JSON auto
inflation will be removed permanently in Chef Client 13.

## Example

When loading an environment from the Chef Infra Server, you might
previously have written:

```ruby
name = 'my_environment'
chef_server_rest.get("environments/#{name}")
```

and received a `Chef::Environment` object back.

## Remediation

You now need to explicitly create a new object of the desired type.

```ruby
name = 'my_environment'
Chef::Environment.from_hash chef_server_rest.get("environments/#{name}")
```
