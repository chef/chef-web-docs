Chef Infra Client uses Ruby as its reference language for creating
cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific
resources. Chef Infra Client provides a reasonable set of resources,
enough to support many of the most common infrastructure automation
scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional
resources and capabilities are required.

Chef Infra Client will run a recipe only when asked. When Chef Infra
Client runs the same recipe more than once, the results will be the same
system state each time. When a recipe is run against a system, but
nothing has changed on either the system or in the recipe, Chef Infra
Client won't change anything.

## Components

A cookbook is comprised of recipes and other optional components as
files or directories.
