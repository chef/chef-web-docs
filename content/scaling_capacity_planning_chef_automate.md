The following disk and CPU utilization metrics for the node visibility
feature in Chef Automate can be used when performing scaling and
capacity planning on your Chef Automate server.

Determining Storage Needs
=========================

Each time a node converges, Chef sends the information about the recipes
and resources used during the run, as well as the node object itself
(including its attributes), to the Chef Automate server. Therefore, the
storage requirements for Chef Automate depend on your node object size,
amount of resources evaluated during a converge, fleet size, and
convergence interval.

For example, if your average node object is 15KB (with a five percent
size buffer for resource/recipe information) and you converge every 15
minutes, the following formula can be used to calculate your total disk
utilization for a day.

``` none
(15KB Node Object * 1.05) * 4 converges/hour * 24 hours = 1,512 KB (1.512 MB)
```

In this example, a single node would require approximately 1.512 MB of
disk space per day. With this knowledge, you can easily compute the disk
space requirements for your entire fleet depending on your node size and
convergence interval.

To determine your node size, you can run the following command:

For a chef-server connected node

``` none
$ chef-shell -z
chef (12.13.37)> "#{node.to_json.size/1024} KB"
```

For a chef-solo node

``` none
$ chef-shell -a
chef (12.13.37)> "#{node.to_json.size/1024} KB"
```

Message Throughput
==================

On a machine provisioned with 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM (the recommended
compute resources for a Chef Automate Server), Chef Automate is able to
reliably process 9000 concurrent converge messages.

When a converge message is received, Chef Automate places the converge
message on a queue managed by RabbitMQ. Depending on CPU utilization, it
can take additional time for Chef Automate to process a significant
burst of messages.
