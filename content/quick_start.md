The quickest way to get started using Chef Infra is to install Chef Workstation and create your first Chef Infra Cookbook:

1. Install Chef Workstation:
    <https://www.chef.io/downloads/tools/tools/workstation>.

2. Generate a Chef Infra repository with an example cookbook:

    ```bash
    chef generate repo my_first_repo
    ```

    where `my_first_repo` is an arbitrary name for your Chef Infra repository.

3. Navigate to the `cookbooks/example` directory.

4. Update the `cookbooks/example/recipes/default.rb` recipe in
    the generated cookbook to contain:

    ```ruby
    file "#{ENV['HOME']}/test.txt" do
      content 'This file was created by Chef Infra!'
    end
    ```

5. Run Chef Infra Client using the `default.rb` recipe:

    ```bash
    chef-client --local-mode --override-runlist example
    ```

This creates a file named `test.txt` at the home path on your computer. Open that file and it will say `This file was created by Chef Infra!`.

- Delete the file, run Chef Infra Client again, and Chef Infra will replace the file.
- Change the string in the file, run Chef Infra Client again, and Chef Infra will make the string in the file the same as the string in the recipe.
- Change the string in the recipe, run Chef Infra Client again, and Chef Infra will update that string to be the same as the one in the recipe.

There's a lot more that Chef Infra can do, obviously, but that was super easy!
