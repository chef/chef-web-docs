The Chef Infra Language includes helper methods for gathering information on the execution of the Chef Infra Client recipe and resource code. This information can be used in recipes and resources to take specific actions.

## Chef Infra Client State

These helpers allow you to understand the state of the node that Chef Infra Client is executing on.

### node

Use the `node` method, often referred to as the node object, to access data collected on the system through [Ohai](/ohai) as well as node attributes set in cookbooks or Policyfiles.

The syntax for the `node` method is as follows:

```ruby
node['specific_attribute']
```

### cookbook_name

Use the `cookbook_name` method to return the name of a cookbook.

The syntax for the `cookbook_name` method is as follows:

```ruby
cookbook_name
```

This method is often used as part of a log entry. For example:

```ruby
Chef::Log.info("I am a message from the #{recipe_name} recipe in the #{cookbook_name} cookbook.")
```

### recipe_name

Use the `recipe_name` method to return the name of a recipe.

The syntax for the `recipe_name` method is as follows:

```ruby
recipe_name
```

This method is often used as part of a log entry. For example:

```ruby
Chef::Log.info("I am a message from the #{recipe_name} recipe in the #{cookbook_name} cookbook.")
```

### resources

Use the `resources` method to look up a resource in the resource collection. The `resources` method returns the value for the resource that it finds in the resource collection. The preferred syntax for the `resources` method is as follows:

```ruby
resources('resource_type[resource_name]')
```

but the following syntax can also be used:

```ruby
resources(resource_type: 'resource_name')
```

where in either approach `resource_type` is the name of a resource and `resource_name` is the name of a resource that can be configured by Chef Infra Client.

The `resources` method can be used to modify a resource later on in a recipe. For example:

```ruby
file '/etc/hosts' do
  content '127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost'
end
```

and then later in the same recipe, or elsewhere:

```ruby
f = resources('file[/etc/hosts]')
f.mode '0644'
```

where `file` is the type of resource, `/etc/hosts` is the name, and `f.mode` is used to set the `mode` property on the **file** resource.

### attribute?

Use the `attribute?` method to ensure that certain actions only execute in the presence of a particular node attribute. The `attribute?` method will return true if one of the listed node attributes matches a node attribute that is detected by Ohai during every Chef Infra Client run.

The syntax for the `attribute?` method is as follows:

```ruby
attribute?('name_of_attribute')
```

For example:

```ruby
if node.attribute?('ipaddress')
  # the node has an ipaddress
end
```

### reboot_pending?

Use the `reboot_pending?` method to test if a node needs a reboot, or is expected to reboot. `reboot_pending?` returns `true` when the node needs a reboot.

The syntax for the `reboot_pending?` method is as follows:

```ruby
reboot_pending?
```

## Executing Code

These helpers allow you to include recipes and impact how resources run on the system.

### include_recipe

{{% cookbooks_recipe_include_in_recipe %}}

### with_run_context

Use the `with_run_context` method to define a block that has a pointer to a location in the `run_context` hierarchy. Resources in recipes always run at the root of the `run_context` hierarchy, whereas custom resources and notification blocks always build a child `run_context` which contains their sub-resources.

The syntax for the `with_run_context` method is as follows:

```ruby
with_run_context :type do
  # some arbitrary pure Ruby stuff goes here
end
```

where `:type` may be one of the following:

- `:root` runs the block as part of the root `run_context` hierarchy
- `:parent` runs the block as part of the parent process in the `run_context` hierarchy

For example:

```ruby
action :run do
  with_run_context :root do
    edit_resource(:my_thing, "accumulated state") do
      action :nothing
      my_array_property << accumulate_some_stuff
    end
  end
  log "kick it off" do
    notifies :run, "my_thing[accumulated state]", :delayed
  end
end
```
