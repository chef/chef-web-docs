The original name for the `ignore_failure` property in resources was
`epic_fail`. Our documentation hasnâ€™t referred to `epic_fail` for years
and out of the 3500 cookbooks on the Supermarket only one uses
`epic_fail`. In Chef Client 14 we will remove the `epic_fail` property
entirely. Foodcritic rule [FC107](http://www.foodcritic.io/#FC107) has
been introduced to detect usage of `epic_fail`.
