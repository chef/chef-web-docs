[\[edit on GitHub\]](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/content/api_push_jobs.md)

The Push Jobs API is used to create jobs and retrieve status using Chef
Push Jobs, a tool that pushes jobs against a set of nodes in the
organization. All requests are signed using the Chef Infra Server API
and the validation key on the workstation from which the requests are
made.

Endpoints
=========

Each authentication request must include
`/organizations/organization_name/pushy/` as part of the name for the
endpoint. For example: `/organizations/organization_name/pushy/jobs/ID`
or `/organizations/organization_name/pushy/node_states`.

{{< note >}}

The easiest way to send commands to the Chef Infra Server from your
workstation is to use the `knife exec` subcommand. Here is an example of
making a basic `knife exec` command against a RESTful JSON API.

``` bash
knife exec -E 'api.get("/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs/JOB_ID")'
```

For some Push Jobs API endpoints, you need to specify certain headers.
To do that you simply pass a hash into the command.

``` bash
knife exec -E 'api.get("/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs/JOB_ID/output/NODE_NAME/stdout", RAW, {"Accept" => "application/event-stream"})'
```

where `RAW` is a boolean indicating whether you want the raw body
returned, or JSON inflated. For Push Jobs API endpoints, we recommend
`false`.

See [knife exec](/workstation/knife_exec/) for detailed information on usage.

### GET

{{% api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_get %}}

### POST

The `POST` method is used to start a job.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

``` xml
POST /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs
```

with a request body similar to:

``` javascript
{
  "command": "bash $PUSHY_JOB_FILE",
  "run_timeout": 300,
  "nodes": ["NODE1", "NODE2", "NODE3", "NODE4", "NODE5", "NODE6"],
  "quorum":
  "user": "rebecca",
  "dir": "/home/rebecca",
  "env": {
    "FOO": "bears"
  },
  "file": "raw:#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello, I am $USER and I like $FOO\""
  "capture_output": true
}
```

where:

-   `command` is the command to be executed during the run.

-   `run_timeout` is the number of seconds to wait for the run to
    complete.

-   `nodes` is the list of node names you wish to run the job on.

-   `quorum` is the number of nodes from `nodes` that must acknowledge
    the request in order for the job to run.

-   `user` is the user you wish to run the job as on the node.

-   `dir` is the directory you wish to run the job from on the node.

-   `env` is a JSON object of key-value pairs to assign to the
    environment.

-   `file` is a string that will be stored as a file on each node, with
    the path provided to the command as an environment variable.

    {{< note spaces=4 >}}

    The string has a required prefix of `raw:` or `base64:`, indicating
    the encoding (if any) of the contents. The path to this file will be
    made available via the `CHEF_PUSH_JOB_FILE` environment variable.

    {{< /note >}}

-   `capture_output` is a boolean indicating whether to capture the
    STDOUT and STDERR for this job. Capture is enabled on a per-job
    basis, meaning that it will affect all nodes that run the job. It is
    not possible to enable capture on a per-node basis.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

``` javascript
{
  "id": "aaaaaaaaaaaa25fd67fa8715fd547d3d"
}
```

{{% api_push_jobs_endpoint_jobs_id %}}

### GET

The `GET` method is used to get the status of an individual job,
including node state (running, complete, crashed).

This method accepts one optional query parameter: `?include_file`. If
set to `true`, then the `file_specified` attributed will be omitted from
`GET` requests and the `file` attribute will be included with the
contents of the file prefixed with `raw:` or `base64:`.

**Request**

``` xml
GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs/ID
```

**Response**

The response will return something similar to:

    complete.
-   `status` is one of the following: `aborted` (the job was aborted),
    `complete` (the job completed; see `nodes` for individual node
    status), `quorum_failed` (the command was not run on any nodes),
    `running` (the command is running), `timed_out` (the command timed
    out), and `voting` (waiting for nodes; quorum not yet met).
-   `created_at` is the date and time at which the job started running
-   `updated_at` is the date and time at which the job entered its
    present `status`
-   `nodes` is one of the following: `aborted` (node ran command,
    stopped before completion), `complete` (node ran command to
    completion), `crashed` (node went down after command started
    running), `nacked` (node was busy), `new` (node has not accepted or
    rejected command), `ready` (node has accepted command, command has
    not started running), `running` (node has accepted command, command
    is running), and `unavailable` (node went down before command
    started).
-   `user` is the user you wish to run the job as on the node.
-   `dir` is the directory you wish to run the job from on the node.
-   `file_specified` is a boolean indicated whether or not a file was
    passed in when the job was created.
-   `capture_output` is a boolean indicating whether the STDOUT and
    STDERR is being capture for this job. If this value is false, it is
    omitted from the output.

jobs/ID/output/NODE_NAME/CHANNEL
---------------------------------

It is possible to capture the output of commands invoked by Push Jobs,
both STDOUT and STDERR, by providing the `capture_output=true` option
when creating a job.

If capture is enabled, then the client will capture both the stdout and
the stderr channels of the command. The channel output will be sent back
regardless of whether the command succeeded or failed. It will be sent
in raw form, including any terminating whitespace. If the command
produced no output, then the value will be an empty string.

The two channels are treated as a pair -- for a given `<job, node>`,
either both will appear, or neither will appear.

The output is not streamed to the server as it is produced. Therefore,
the output data for a given node will not be available until the run on
that node is complete.

### GET

The `GET` method is used to get output from a channel (`STDOUT` or
`STDERR`) for an individual job.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be `application/octet-stream`.

**Request**

``` xml
Accept: application/octet-stream
GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs/ID/output/NODE_NAME/stdout
```

**Response**

The response will return something similar to:

``` xml
Starting Chef Client, version 12.11.18

...

Converging 23 resources

Running handlers:
Running handlers complete
Chef client finished, 23/187 resources updated in 15 seconds
```

**Request**

``` xml
Accept: application/octet-stream
GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs/ID/output/NODE_NAME/stderr
```

**Response**\*

The response will return something similar to:

``` xml
bash: no such file or directory: /usr/local/run.sh
```

jobs_status_feed
------------------

The `/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed` endpoint has the
following methods: `GET`

### GET

This endpoint opens a Server-Sent-Events (SSE) feed for job starts and
completions within the entire organization.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be `application/event-stream`.

As specified in the SSE protocol, you may request all events since a
particular ID by including the optional `Last-Event-ID` Header. If this
header is not included, no events will be produced until the next
activity in the organization produces an event. If the `Last-Event-ID`
header is passed but not recognized, it is assumed that the ID has
already expired, and the feed will produce the events as far back as are
recorded, proceeded by a synthetic `start_of_history`. The expiration
time of organization events is 60 seconds (configurable).

**Request**

``` xml
Accept: text/event-stream
Last-Event-ID: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d1
GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed
```

**Response**

The response will return something similar to:

``` xml

jobs_status_feed/JOBID
------------------------

The `/organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed/JOBID` endpoint has
the following methods: `GET`

### GET

This endpoint opens a Server-Sent-Events (SSE) feed with the Push Jobs
server.

This method has no parameters.

The Accept header for this request must be `application/event-stream`.

As specified in the SSE protocol, you may request all events since a
particular ID by including the optional `Last-Event-ID` Header. If the
ID is omitted, or not recognized, the stream will start from the
beginning of the job.

**Completed Jobs**

In the job feed, for a brief period after a job completes, the event
stream will remain available. The request will behave as normal, which
means the client will see the stream of events from the beginning of the
job (or if specified, the `Last-Event-ID`), through to the job
completion, and then the connection will be immediately closed by the
server. The amount of time before it completes is configurable, but
defaults to 5 seconds.

If a request is made for the feed after the waiting period, then the
request will result in a single event, a "summary" event, which contains
the same data as requesting a named-job resource. In this case, any
`Last-Event-ID` will be ignored.

**Request**

``` xml
Accept: text/event-stream
GET /organizations/ORG_NAME/pushy/jobs_status_feed/JOBID
```

**Response**

The response will return something similar to:
