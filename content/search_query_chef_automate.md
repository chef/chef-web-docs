The dashboard in the **Nodes** tab exposes a search bar that allows you
to search for nodes based off a defined set of filters. You can search
on the following terms:

> -   Attribute
> -   Cookbook
> -   Environment
> -   Node Name
> -   Platform
> -   Policy Group
> -   Policy Name
> -   Policy Revision
> -   Recipe
> -   Resource Name
> -   Role

{{< info >}}

The functionality described in this topic is for the search bar in Chef
Automate 1.6.87 or later. If you need to continue using the previous
search bar that was in earlier versions of Chef Automate, you can enable
this view easily. We have included a new feature flag to activate the
old search bar by typing `legacy` in the UI and toggling on this view in
the menu. If you have trouble with the new search bar and find yourself
continuing to use the legacy version, please [contact
us](https://feedback.chef.io/) with your feedback. Also, the legacy
search bar will only be supported for 90 days.

Applying a filter
=================

To apply a filter, do the following:

1.  Either begin typing one of the terms above to autocomplete the
    filter name or place your cursor in the search bar to bring up the
    filter list.
2.  Enter the value you wish to search on. Nesting in values should be
    denoted by dot(.)s. For an example, see the Attribute or Node Name
    examples below.
3.  Click the blue arrow at the end of the search bar to apply the
    filter to your node data set.

Applying multiple filters
=========================

Multiple filters can be entered into the search bar to further focus
search results by entering the search filter and pressing `Enter` on
your keyboard. The filter will then show up underneath the search bar.
Additional filters can be applied, but note that these will be
considered AND searches, which means the result list will be a union of
both filtered results. Once you have created your combined filter, click
the blue arrow at the end of the search bar.

The following example shows how to search for nodes in a particular
environment that are on the same platform.

Using wildcards
===============

In the screenshot above, one of the filters uses a wildcard(\*) in the
value. You can use wildcards either at the beginning, end, or on both
beginning and end of a given value to provide further customization on
how you filter your nodes. If you do not specify a wildcard, then only
exact matches will be returned.

Examples
--------

**Attribute**

> All aws nodes with a public ip: `Attribute: ec2.public_ipv4`

**Cookbook**

> All nodes running the 'postgres' cookbook: `Cookbook: postgresql`

**Recipe**

> All nodes running a 'server' recipe: `Recipe: server`

**Resource Name**

> All nodes that manage a resource named '/tmp': `Resource Name: /tmp`

**Node Name**

> The node named 'node1.chef.io': `Node Name: node1.chef.io`
