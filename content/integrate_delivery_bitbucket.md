Bitbucket integration with Chef Automate allows Bitbucket to be used as
the canonical git repository for projects while at the same time
benefiting from Chef Automate workflow and pipeline automation. When
Bitbucket integration is enabled for a project in Bitbucket, you will be
able to:

-   Review pull requests and make code comments in the Bitbucket webui
-   Browse code (including in-flight changes in the Chef Automate
    pipeline) using Bitbucket
-   Have the target branch (usually master) of a Bitbucket project
    repository be managed by Chef Automate. When a change is approved in
    Chef Automate, it will perform the merge in Bitbucket

Bitbucket integration is designed for use with Bitbucket 3.x or 4.x and
supports connecting a Chef Automate enterprise with a single Bitbucket
server URL. Chef Automate does not support Bitbucket project
repositories that are hosted at <https://bitbucket.org> at this time.
Chef Automate communicates with Bitbucket using the Bitbucket REST API
and HTTP-based git protocol. Chef Automate authenticates with Bitbucket
with a user account over HTTP basic authentication. It is recommended
that the connection be protected using SSL.

Trust SSL Certificate
=====================

Run the following steps to set up self-signed certificates for Chef
Automate.

{{< info >}}

This is only required if the Bitbucket uses a self-signed SSL
certificate or an internal certificate authority.

{{< /info >}}

Debian
------

For the Debian platform, do the following:

1.  Log into the Chef Automate server as root.

2.  Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
    ```

3.  Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect {BITBUCKET_SERVER}:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM >{BITBUCKET_SERVER}.crt
    ```

4.  Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    update-ca-certificates
    ```

    ``` bash
    cd /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
    ```

5.  Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect {BITBUCKET_SERVER}:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM >{BITBUCKET_SERVER}.crt
    ```

6.  Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    update-ca-trust extract
    ```

Set up Integration
==================

Bitbucket integration with Chef Automate has the following requirements:

1.  Shell access with `sudo` permission to the Chef Automate server
2.  A Chef Automate user account with `admin` role in the Chef Automate
    enterprise used for this integration
3.  The URL for the Bitbucket instance
4.  The username and password of a Bitbucket user to use as the service
    account. This user must have full access (read/write) to the
    projects you wish to add to Chef Automate

Add to Chef Automate
--------------------

In the Chef Automate web UI, open the SCM setup page, and then complete
the following fields:

-   **Bitbucket URL** - The URL for your Bitbucket instance.
-   **Bitbucket Username** - The username of the service account that
    Chef Automate will use to interact with Bitbucket.
-   **Bitbucket Password** - The password for the service account.

Then submit the form to complete this step.

Remove from Chef Automate
-------------------------

To remove integration with Bitbucket:

1.  Update all projects that are integrated with Bitbucket to be
    integrated with Chef Automate.
2.  In the Chef Automate webui, open the **SCM Setup** page.
3.  Click the **Remove Link** button.

Update Integration
------------------

To update integration with Bitbucket:

1.  In the Chef Automate web UI, open the **SCM Setup** page, and update
    Bitbucket credentials and make changes to the appropriate
    information.
2.  Click the **Update** button.

Create a Project
================

Repeat these steps for each Bitbucket project to be added to Chef
Automate:

1.  A project repository in Bitbucket with at least one commit.
2.  The service account used by Chef Automate must have full access to
    this repository.
3.  All team members should have read-only access to this repository.
    Chef Automate will manage creation of pull requests and merging of
    pull requests to Bitbucket.

Add an Empty Project
--------------------

Use the following steps to add an empty project from the Chef Automate
web UI:

1.  Open the page for the organization in the Chef Automate webui, and
    then click **Add a New Project**.
2.  Select the **Bitbucket** option from the **Source Code Provider**
    bar, and then and enter the Bitbucket project key, repository, and
    target branch.
3.  Click **Save & Close**.

Import Project
--------------

You can repeat these steps for each Bitbucket project to be added to
Chef Automate:

1.  Create a local clone of the project **from Bitbucket** and `cd` into
    it.

2.  Create a `.delivery/cli.toml` using `delivery setup`:

    ``` bash
    $ delivery setup --ent=$DELIVERY_ENTERPRISE --org=$DELIVERY_ORG --user=$DELIVERY_USER_NAME --server=$DELIVERY_SERVER
    ```

3.  Run `delivery init` to push the code to the empty project in Chef
    Automate (as created above). After importing the code, this command
    will generate a `.delivery/config.json` file, create a build
    cookbook, and submit a change to Chef Automate to initialize a
    pipeline for the project. Changes are opened in the Chef Automate
    web UI. At this point, a corresponding pull request is shown in
    Bitbucket.

Convert Project to Bitbucket
----------------------------

To convert a project that is integrated with Chef Automate to one that
is integrated with Bitbucket:

1.  Ensure that a project repository exists in Bitbucket with at least
    one commit.
2.  Ensure that the service account used by Chef Automate has full
    access to this project repository.
3.  Ensure that team members who will use this project have read-only
    access to this project repository. (Chef Automate will manage the
    creation and merging of pull requests.)
4.  In the Chef Automate web user interface, open the **Organizations**
    page.
5.  Click the pencil button for the project to be updated.
6.  Click the **Bitbucket** tab.
7.  Enter the project key and the project repository name.
8.  Click **Save and Close**.

Convert Project to Chef Automate
--------------------------------

To convert a project that is integrated with Bitbucket to one that is
integrated with Chef Automate:

1.  Merge or close all open changes for the project.
2.  In the Chef Automate webui, open the **Organizations** page.
3.  Click the pencil button for the project to be updated.
4.  Click the **Chef Delivery** tab.
5.  Click **Save and Close**.

Update Bitbucket Project
------------------------

To update the information for a project that is integrated with
Bitbucket:

1.  In the Chef Automate web UI, open the **Organizations** page.
2.  Click the pencil button for the project to be updated.
3.  Click the **Bitbucket** tab.
4.  Edit the project key and the project repository name.
5.  Click **Save and Close**.

Workflow w/Bitbucket
====================

This section describes the setup and workflow for a team member who will
interact with a Bitbucket project that is integrated with Chef Automate.
It is assumed that the initial project is created, imported, and that a
Chef Automate pipeline already exists.

Delivery CLI
------------

Perform the following steps to install the Delivery CLI and setup your
project:

1.  [Install the Delivery CLI](/delivery_cli.html#install-delivery-cli).

2.  In the command shell, create or navigate to the directory in which
    project repositories are located.

3.  Use the `delivery setup` command with the following arguments to
    create the `.delivery/cli.toml` file:

    ``` bash
    $ delivery setup --ent=$DELIVERY_ENTERPRISE --org=$DELIVERY_ORG --user=$DELIVERY_USER --server=$DELIVERY_SERVER
    ```

4.  Create a local clone of the project repository:

    ``` bash
    $ delivery clone $PROJECT
    ```

    If the project is cloned from Bitbucket (or if a pre-existing clone
    is used), add it using `delivery remote`. The URL for
    `delivery clone` can be found on the project's page in the Chef
    Automate web UI.

5.  Create a remote with the following:

    ``` bash
    $ git remote add delivery $DELIVERY_CLONE_URL
    ```

Create a Change
---------------

Use the following steps to create a change in Chef Automate:

1.  Create and check out a topic branch for the change, based on the
    current state of your project's pipeline (usually from `master`).
    For example: `git checkout -b great-feature`.
2.  Make and commit changes to the project as normal.
3.  Submit the change to Chef Automate with the command
    `delivery review`. This command will open a URL at which details and
    progress of the change may be viewed from the Chef Automate web UI.
4.  Verification of changes will begin automatically and a corresponding
    pull request will be opened in Bitbucket.

Code Review
-----------

You may conduct a code review using either Chef Automate or Bitbucket.
However, merging a pull request is handled by Chef Automate and occurs
when a change in Chef Automate is approved. You cannot merge the pull
request from within Bitbucket.

To perform code review using Chef Automate:

1.  Use the URL created by `delivery review` to go directly to the
    change in the Chef Automate web UI, or browse to the change from the
    Chef Automate dashboard.
2.  Click the **Review** tab.
3.  Browse the changes and make comments.

Approve a Change
----------------

When verification is finished in Chef Automate and the code has been
reviewed and is ready to be merged, approve the change. The pull request
will be merged and closed in Bitbucket. The feature branch will also be
deleted in Bitbucket.

1.  Use the URL created by `delivery review` to go directly to the
    change in the Chef Automate web UI, or browse to the change from the
    Chef Automate dashboard.
2.  Click the **Review** tab.
3.  Click **Approve**.

Delete a Change
---------------

When verification is finished in Chef Automate, the code has been
reviewed, and it is decided the change should never be approved, delete
the change in Chef Automate; the pull request will be declined and
closed in Bitbucket. The feature branch will also be deleted in
Bitbucket.

Use the URL created by `delivery review` to go directly to the change,
or browse to the change from the dashboard in the Chef Automate web UI.

1.  Click the **Review** tab.
2.  Click **Delete**.
