Custom Ohai plugins describe additional configuration attributes to be
collected by Ohai and provided to Chef Infra Client during runs.

Ohai plugins are written in Ruby with a plugin DSL documented below.
Being written in Ruby provides access to all of Ruby's built-in
functionality, as well as 3rd party gem functionality. Plugins can parse
the output of any local command on the node, or they can fetch data from
external APIs. Examples of plugins that users have written: - A plugin
to gather node information including datacenter, rack, and rack position
from an inventory server - A plugin to gather additional RAID array
information from a controller utility - A plugin to gather hardware
warranty information from a vendor API

See [About Ohai](/ohai/) for information on Ohai configuration and
usage.

Syntax
======

The syntax for an Ohai plugin is as follows:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin(:Name) do
  provides 'attribute', 'attribute/subattribute'
  depends 'attribute', 'attribute'

  def shared_method
    # some Ruby code that defines the shared method
    attribute my_data
  end

  collect_data(:default) do
    # some Ruby code
    attribute my_data
  end

  collect_data(:platform...) do
    # some Ruby code that defines platform-specific requirements
    attribute my_data
  end
end
```

where

-   Required. `(:Name)` is used to identify the plugin; when two plugins
    have the same `(:Name)`, those plugins are joined together and run
    as if they were a single plugin. This value must be a valid Ruby
    class name, starting with a capital letter and containing only
    alphanumeric characters
-   Required. `provides` is a comma-separated list of one (or more)
    attributes that are defined by this plugin. This attribute will
    become an automatic attribute (i.e. `node['attribute']`) after it is
    collected by Ohai at the start of a Chef Infra Client run. An
    attribute can also be defined using an `attribute/subattribute`
    pattern
-   `depends` is a comma-separated list of one (or more) attributes that
    are collected by another plugin; as long as the value is collected
    by another Ohai plugin, it can be used by any plugin
-   `shared_method` defines code that can be shared among one (or more)
    `collect_data` blocks; for example, instead of defining a mash for
    each `collect_data` block, the code can be defined as a shared
    method, and then called from any `collect_data` block
-   `collect_data` is a block of Ruby code that is called by Ohai when
    it runs; one (or more) `collect_data` blocks can be defined in a
    plugin, but only a single `collect_data` block is ever run.
-   `collect_data(:default)` is the code block that runs when a node's
    platform is not defined by a platform-specific `collect_data` block
-   `collect_data(:platform)` is a platform-specific code block that is
    run when a match exists between the node's platform and this
    `collect_data` block; only one `collect_data` block may exist for
    each platform; possible values: `:aix`, `:darwin`, `:freebsd`,
    `:linux`, `:openbsd`, `:netbsd`, `:solaris2`, `:windows`, or any
    other value from `RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os']`
-   `my_data` is string (`a string value`) or an empty mash
    (`{ :setting_a => 'value_a', :setting_b => 'value_b' }`). This is
    used to define the data that should be collected by the plugin

For example, the following plugin looks up data on virtual machines
hosted in Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, Eucalyptus,
Linode, OpenStack, and Microsoft Azure:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin(:Cloud) do
  provides 'cloud'

  depends 'ec2'
  depends 'gce'
  depends 'rackspace'
  depends 'eucalyptus'
  depends 'linode'
  depends 'openstack'
  depends 'azure'

  def create_objects
    cloud Mash.new
    cloud[:public_ips] = []
    cloud[:private_ips] = []
  end

  ...

  def on_gce?
    gce != nil
  end

  def get_gce_values
    cloud[:public_ipv4] = []
    cloud[:local_ipv4] = []

    public_ips = gce['instance']['networkInterfaces'].collect do |interface|
      if interface.has_key?('accessConfigs')
        interface['accessConfigs'].collect{|ac| ac['externalIp']}
      end
    end.flatten.compact

    private_ips = gce['instance']['networkInterfaces'].collect do |interface|
      interface['ip']
    end.compact

    cloud[:public_ips] += public_ips
    cloud[:private_ips] += private_ips
    cloud[:public_ipv4] +=  public_ips
    cloud[:public_hostname] = nil
    cloud[:local_ipv4] += private_ips
    cloud[:local_hostname] = gce['instance']['hostname']
    cloud[:provider] = 'gce'
  end

  ...

  # with following similar code blocks for each cloud provider
```

where

-   `provides` defines the `cloud` attribute, which is then turned into
    an object using the `create_objects` shared method, which then
    generates a hash based on public or private IP addresses
-   if the cloud provider is Google Compute Engine, then based on the IP
    address for the node, the `cloud` attribute data is populated into a
    hash

Ohai DSL Methods
================

The Ohai DSL is a Ruby DSL that is used to define an Ohai plugin and to
ensure that Ohai collects the right data at the start of every Chef
Infra Client run. The Ohai DSL is a small DSL with a single method that
is specific to Ohai plugins. Because the Ohai DSL is a Ruby DSL,
anything that can be done using Ruby can also be done when defining an
Ohai plugin.

collect_data
-------------

The `collect_data` method is a block of Ruby code that is called by Ohai
when it runs. One (or more) `collect_data` blocks can be defined in a
plugin, but only a single `collect_data` block is ever run. The
`collect_data` block that is run is determined by the platform on which
the node is running, which is then matched up against the available
`collect_data` blocks in the plugin.

-   A `collect_data(:default)` block is used when Ohai is not able to
    match the platform of the node with a `collect_data(:platform)`
    block in the plugin
-   A `collect_data(:platform)` block is required for each platform that
    requires non-default behavior

When Ohai runs, if there isn't a matching `collect_data` block for a
platform, the `collect_data(:default)` block is used. The syntax for the
`collect_data` method is:

``` ruby
collect_data(:default) do
  # some Ruby code
end
```

or:

``` ruby
collect_data(:platform) do
  # some Ruby code
end
```

where:

-   `:default` is the name of the default `collect_data` block
-   `:platform` is the name of a platform, such as `:aix` for AIX or
    `:windows` for Microsoft Windows

### Use a Mash

Use a mash to store data. This is done by creating a new mash, and then
setting an attribute to it. For example:

``` ruby
provides 'name_of_mash'
name_of_mash Mash.new
name_of_mash[:attribute] = 'value'
```

### Examples

The following examples show how to use the `collect_data` block:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin(:Azure) do
  provides 'azure'

  collect_data do
    azure_metadata_from_hints = hint?('azure')
    if azure_metadata_from_hints
      Ohai::Log.debug('azure_metadata_from_hints is present.')
      azure Mash.new
      azure_metadata_from_hints.each {|k, v| azure[k] = v }
    else
      Ohai::Log.debug('No hints present for azure.')
      false
    end
  end
end
```

or:

``` ruby
require 'ohai/mixin/ec2_metadata'
extend Ohai::Mixin::Ec2Metadata

Ohai.plugin do
  provides 'openstack'

  collect_data do
    if hint?('openstack') || hint?('hp')
      Ohai::Log.debug('ohai openstack')
      openstack Mash.new
      if can_metadata_connect?(EC2_METADATA_ADDR,80)
        Ohai::Log.debug('connecting to the OpenStack metadata service')
        self.fetch_metadata.each {|k, v| openstack[k] = v }
        case
        when hint?('hp')
          openstack['provider'] = 'hp'
        else
          openstack['provider'] = 'openstack'
        end
      else
        Ohai::Log.debug('unable to connect to the OpenStack metadata service')
      end
    else
      Ohai::Log.debug('NOT ohai openstack')
    end
  end
end
```

require
-------

The `require` method is a standard Ruby method that can be used to list
files that may be required by a platform, such as an external class
library. As a best practice, even though the `require` method is often
used at the top of a Ruby file, it is recommended that the use of the
`require` method be used as part of the platform-specific `collect_data`
block. For example, the Ruby WMI is required with Microsoft Windows:

``` ruby
collect_data(:windows) do
  require 'ruby-wmi'
  WIN32OLE.codepage = WIN32OLE::CP_UTF8

  kernel Mash.new

  host = WMI::Win32_OperatingSystem.find(:first)
  kernel[:os_info] = Mash.new
  host.properties_.each do |p|
    kernel[:os_info][p.name.wmi_underscore.to_sym] = host.send(p.name)
  end

  ...

end
```

Ohai will attempt to fully qualify the name of any class by prepending
`Ohai::` to the loaded class. For example both:

``` ruby
require Ohai::Mixin::ShellOut
```

and:

``` ruby
require Mixin::ShellOut
```

are both understood by the Ohai in the same way:
`Ohai::Mixin::ShellOut`.

When a class is an external class (and therefore should not have
`Ohai::` prepended), use `::` to let the Ohai know. For example:

``` ruby
::External::Class::Library
```

### /common Directory

The `/common` directory stores code that is used across all Ohai
plugins. For example, a file in the `/common` directory named
`virtualization.rb` that includes code like the following:

``` ruby
module Ohai
  module Common
    module Virtualization

      def host?(virtualization)
        !virtualization.nil? && virtualization[:role].eql?('host')
      end

      def open_virtconn(system)
        begin
          require 'libvirt'
          require 'hpricot'
        rescue LoadError => e
          Ohai::Log.debug('Cannot load gem: #{e}.')
        end

        emu = (system.eql?('kvm') ? 'qemu' : system)
        virtconn = Libvirt::open_read_only('#{emu}:///system')
      end

      ...

      def networks(virtconn)
        networks = Mash.new
        virtconn.list_networks.each do |n|
          nv = virtconn.lookup_network_by_name n
          networks[n] = Mash.new
          networks[n][:xml_desc] = (nv.xml_desc.split('\n').collect {|line| line.strip}).join
          ['bridge_name','uuid'].each {|a| networks[n][a] = nv.send(a)}
          #xdoc = Hpricot networks[n][:xml_desc]
        end
        networks
      end

      ...

    end
  end
end
```

can then be leveraged in a plugin by using the `require` method to
require the `virtualization.rb` file and then later calling each of the
methods in the required module:

``` ruby
require 'ohai/common/virtualization'

Ohai.plugin(:Virtualization) do
  include Ohai::Common::Virtualization

  provides 'virtualization'
  %w{ capabilities domains networks storage }.each do |subattr|
    provides 'virtualization/#{subattr}'
  end

  collect_data(:linux) do
    virtualization Mash.new

    ...

    if host?(virtualization)
      v = open_virtconn(virtualization[:system])

      virtualization[:libvirt_version] = libvirt_version(v)
      virtualization[:nodeinfo] = nodeinfo(v)
      virtualization[:uri] = uri(v)
      virtualization[:capabilities] = capabilities(v)
      virtualization[:domains] = domains(v)
      virtualization[:networks] = networks(v)
      virtualization[:storage] = storage(v)

      close_virtconn(v)
    end
```

Shared Methods
--------------

A shared method defines behavior that may be used by more than one
`collect_data` block, such as a data structure, a hash, or a mash. The
syntax for a shared method is:

``` ruby
def a_shared_method
  # some Ruby code that defines the shared method
end
```

For example, the following shared method is used to collect data about
various cloud providers, depending on the cloud provider and the type of
IP address:

``` ruby
def create_objects
  cloud Mash.new
  cloud[:public_ips] = Array.new
  cloud[:private_ips] = Array.new
end
```

and then later on in the same plugin, the `cloud` object can be reused:

``` ruby
def get_linode_values
  cloud[:public_ips] << linode['public_ip']
  cloud[:private_ips] << linode['private_ip']
  cloud[:public_ipv4] = linode['public_ipv4']
  cloud[:public_hostname] = linode['public_hostname']
  cloud[:local_ipv4] = linode['local_ipv4']
  cloud[:local_hostname] = linode['local_hostname']
  cloud[:provider] = 'linode'
end
```

and

``` ruby
def get_azure_values
  cloud[:vm_name] = azure['vm_name']
  cloud[:public_ips] << azure['public_ip']
  cloud[:public_fqdn] = azure['public_fqdn']
  cloud[:public_ssh_port] = azure['public_ssh_port'] if azure['public_ssh_port']
  cloud[:public_winrm_port] = azure['public_winrm_port'] if azure['public_winrm_port']
  cloud[:provider] = 'azure'
end
```

and so on, for each of the various cloud providers.

Logging
=======

Use the `Ohai::Log` class in an Ohai plugin to define log entries that
are created by Ohai. The syntax for a log message is as follows:

``` ruby
Ohai::Log.log_type('message')
```

where

-   `log_type` can be `.debug`, `.info`, `.warn`, `.error`, or `.fatal`
-   `'message'` is the message that is logged.

For example:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin do
  provides 'openstack'

  collect_data do
    if hint?('openstack') || hint?('hp')
      Ohai::Log.debug('ohai openstack')
      openstack Mash.new
      if can_metadata_connect?(EC2_METADATA_ADDR,80)
        Ohai::Log.debug('connecting to the OpenStack metadata service')
        self.fetch_metadata.each {|k, v| openstack[k] = v }
        case
        when hint?('hp')
          openstack['provider'] = 'hp'
        else
          openstack['provider'] = 'openstack'
        end
      else
        Ohai::Log.debug('unable to connect to the OpenStack metadata service')
      end
    else
      Ohai::Log.debug('NOT ohai openstack')
    end
  end
end
```

rescue
------

Use the `rescue` clause to make sure that a log message is always
provided. For example:

``` ruby
rescue LoadError => e
  Ohai::Log.debug('ip_scopes: cannot load gem, plugin disabled: #{e}')
end
```

Examples
========

{{< note >}}

See <https://github.com/rackerlabs/ohai-plugins/tree/master/plugins> for
some great examples of custom Ohai plugins.

{{< /note >}}

The following examples show different ways of building Ohai plugins.

collect_data Blocks
--------------------

The following Ohai plugin uses multiple `collect_data` blocks and shared
methods to define platforms:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin(:Hostname) do
  provides 'domain', 'fqdn', 'hostname'

  def from_cmd(cmd)
    so = shell_out(cmd)
    so.stdout.split($/)[0]
  end

  def collect_domain
    if fqdn
      fqdn =~ /.+?\.(.*)/
      domain $1
    end
  end

  collect_data(:aix, :hpux) do
    hostname from_cmd('hostname -s')
    fqdn from_cmd('hostname')
    domain collect_domain
  end

  collect_data(:darwin, :netbsd, :openbsd) do
    hostname from_cmd('hostname -s')
    fqdn from_cmd('hostname')
    domain collect_domain
  end

  collect_data(:freebsd) do
    hostname from_cmd('hostname -s')
    fqdn from_cmd('hostname -f')
    domain collect_domain
  end

  collect_data(:linux) do
    hostname from_cmd('hostname -s')
    begin
      fqdn from_cmd('hostname --fqdn')
    rescue
      Ohai::Log.debug('hostname -f returned an error, probably no domain is set')
    end
    domain collect_domain
  end

  collect_data(:solaris2) do
    require 'socket'

    hostname from_cmd('hostname')

    fqdn_lookup = Socket.getaddrinfo(hostname, nil, nil, nil, nil, Socket::AI_CANONNAME).first[2]
    if fqdn_lookup.split('.').length > 1
      # we received an fqdn
      fqdn fqdn_lookup
    else
      # default to assembling one
      h = from_cmd('hostname')
      d = from_cmd('domainname')
      fqdn '#{h}.#{d}'
    end

    domain collect_domain
  end

  collect_data(:windows) do
    require 'ruby-wmi'
    require 'socket'

    host = WMI::Win32_ComputerSystem.find(:first)
    hostname '#{host.Name}'

    info = Socket.gethostbyname(Socket.gethostname)
    if info.first =~ /.+?\.(.*)/
      fqdn info.first
    else
      # host is not in dns. optionally use:
      # C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
      fqdn Socket.gethostbyaddr(info.last).first
    end

   domain collect_domain
  end
end
```

Use a mixin Library
-------------------

The following Ohai example shows a plugin can use a `mixin` library and
also depend on another plugin:

``` ruby
require 'ohai/mixin/os'

Ohai.plugin(:Os) do
  provides 'os', 'os_version'
  depends 'kernel'

  collect_data do
    os collect_os
    os_version kernel[:release]
  end
end
```

Get Kernel Values
-----------------

The following Ohai example shows part of a file that gets initial kernel
attribute values:

``` ruby
Ohai.plugin(:Kernel) do
  provides 'kernel', 'kernel/modules'

  def init_kernel
    kernel Mash.new
    [['uname -s', :name], ['uname -r', :release],
    ['uname -v', :version], ['uname -m', :machine]].each do |cmd, property|
      so = shell_out(cmd)
      kernel[property] = so.stdout.split($/)[0]
    end
    kernel
  end

  ...

  collect_data(:darwin) do
    kernel init_kernel
    kernel[:os] = kernel[:name]

    so = shell_out('sysctl -n hw.optional.x86_64')
    if so.stdout.split($/)[0].to_i == 1
      kernel[:machine] = 'x86_64'
    end

    modules = Mash.new
    so = shell_out('kextstat -k -l')
    so.stdout.lines do |line|
      if line =~ /(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+0x[0-9a-f]+\s+0x([0-9a-f]+)\s+0x[0-9a-f]+\s+([a-zA-Z0-9\.]+) \(([0-9\.]+)\)/
        kext[$4] = { :version => $5, :size => $3.hex, :index => $1, :refcount => $2 }
      end
    end

    kernel[:modules] = modules
  end

  ...
```
