In Ohai/Chef Client 13 we replaced the existing Cloud plugin with the
Cloud V2 plugin. That was done by having Ohai populate both
`node['cloud']` and `node['cloud_v2']` with the data previously found at
`node['cloud_v2']`. In Chef Client 14 we will no longer populate
`node['cloud_v2']`.

## Remediation

If you have a cookbook that relies on data from `node['cloud_v2']` you
will need to update the code to instead use `node['cloud']` attributes.
Keep in mind that if you're attempting to support Chef \< 13 this data
will be different. Foodcritic's FC095 rule will detect any usage of the
`node['cloud_v2']` attributes.
