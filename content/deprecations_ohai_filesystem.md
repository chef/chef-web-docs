In Ohai/Chef Client 13 we replaced the existing Filesystem plugin with
the Filesystem2 plugin. This was done by having the Filesystem2 plugin
populate both `node['fileystem2']` and `node['filesystem']`. The
Filesystem2 plugin includes a different data format that resolves many
of the longstanding bugs in the Filesystem plugin.

## Remediation

If you have a cookbook that relies on data from `node['filesystem']` you
will need to update the code to use data in the new format when
migrating to Chef Client 13 or later. On a Chef Client 12 or earlier
node you can view the new format by running <span class="title-ref">ohai
filesystem2</span> or on a Chef Client 13+ node you can run
`ohai filesystem`.

The output of the filesystem plugin is too large to show the difference
here, but as an example code that may reference
`node['/dev/xvda1']['kb_size']` would need to be updated to reference
`node['by_device']['/dev/xvda1']['kb_size']` as filesystem data is now
displayed by both devices and mounts.
