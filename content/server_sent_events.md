The Push Jobs server provides feeds of events associated with actions,
via the [Server-Sent-Events (SSE)
protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/). There are two SSE feeds
available:

1.  Job Feed: Stream of events for a particular job
2.  Organization Feed: Stream of events for all jobs across an
    organization

Event Types
===========

As mandated by the SSE protocol, each event has:

-   a type-specifier (`event`)
-   an ID (`id`)
-   `data`

The structure of an individual event appears as follows:

``` xml
event: EVENT_TYPE
id: EVENT_ID
data: {"timestamp": "2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z", ...}
```

-   `EVENT_TYPE` varies depending on the stream you request. In a Job
    Feed you could receive `start`, `quorum_vote`, `quorum_succeeded`,
    `run_start`, `run_complete`, `job_complete`, `rehab`, and `summary`.
    In the Organization Feed you could receive `start`, `job_complete`,
    and `start_of_history`.
-   `EVENT_ID` is not globally unique. It is an opaque string that is
    unique only to the individual stream.
-   `data` is a JSON object which content depends on the event. However,
    the JSON object for each event type includes a server-based
    timestamp in ISO8601 format.

In addition, SSE allows comments in the stream, indicated by a starting
colon. Push Jobs Server uses comments to send "no-op" events every 15
(configurable) seconds, as a form of keepalive for the socket.

start
-----

This event is issued when a job is requested.

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: start
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","job":"768b8d57-3cd0-434c-9f98-77e52cb96b86","command":"chef-client","run_timeout":300,"user":"rebecca","quorum":3,"node_count":3}
```

where:

-   `job` is the Job ID. (Not present in Job Feed)
-   `command` is the command that was run
-   `run_timeout` is the timeout in seconds specified in the job request
-   `user` is the user making the job request
-   `quorum` is the number of clients required to accept the command as
    specified in the job request
-   `node_count` is the number of nodes in the request

quorum_vote
------------

This event is issued as each node responds to the quorum request. (Not
available in Organization Feed)

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: quorum_vote
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","node":"NODE1","status":"success"}
```

where:

-   `node` is the name of the node responding to the vote
-   `status` is one of the following: `client_died_while_voting` (node
    went offline during voting), `failure` (node rejected the job),
    `lost_availability` (node become unavailable during voting),
    `success` (node accepted the job), `unexpected_commit` (node
    attempted to vote twice)

quorum_succeeded
-----------------

This event is issued when the vote is complete, and the nodes are told
to run the command. (Not available in Organization Feed)

Please note: there is no corresponding `quorum_failed` event. If the
quorum fails, then the `job_complete` event will include a
"quorum_failed" status.

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: quorum_succeeded
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp": "2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z"}
```

run_start
----------

This event is issued as each node acknowledges that it is running the
command. (Not available in Organization Feed)

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: run_start
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","node":"NODE1"}
```

where:

-   `node` is the name of the node

run_complete
-------------

This event is issued as each node completes the command. (Not available
in Organization Feed)

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: run_complete,
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","node":"NODE1","status":"crashed"}
```

where:

-   `node` is the name of the node
-   `status` is one of the following: `client_died_while_running` (node
    went offline before finishing the run), `crashed` (node terminated
    run without returning status), `failure` (run failed), `run_nacked`
    (node rejected the run after quorum was reached),
    `run_nacked_while_running` (node rejected the run after starting
    it), or `success` (the run completed successfully),

job_complete
-------------

This event is issued when the job completes.

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: job_complete
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","job":"768b8d57-3cd0-434c-9f98-77e52cb96b86","status":"complete"}
```

where:

-   `job` is the Job ID (Not present in Job Feed)
-   `status` is one of the following: `aborted` (the job was aborted),
    `complete` (the job completed), `quorum_failed` (the command was not
    run on any nodes), or `timed_out` (the command timed out)

start_of_history
------------------

This synthetic event is issued when the `Last-Event-ID` header is not
recognized. (Not available in Job Feed)

**Example Event**

``` xml
event: start_of_history
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z"}
```

rehab
-----

This event is issued when the server detects an abnormality with a node
and attempts to repair it. (Not available in Organization Feed)

``` xml
event: rehab
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","node":"NODE1"}
```

summary
-------

This event is issued when a request for the Job Feed comes in after the
job has completed. (Not available in Organization Feed)

``` xml
event: summary
id: dcd37f50-2d77-4761-895b-33134dbf87d5
data: {"timestamp":"2014-07-10 05:17:44.995958Z","id":"aaaaaaaaaaaa25fd67fa8715fd547d3d","command":"chef-client", ... }
```

where:

-   `data` is the same Job Summary you would get from the `job/ID`
    endpoint
