When Ohai was first released it depended on the sigar gem for
discovering system configuration details. As time went on Ohai was
expanded with built-in discovery methods for various platforms. The
sigar gem was still required by Ohai and used primarily for the HP-UX
platform. The SIGAR project is no longer active, and there is no longer
an active port of Ruby to HP-UX. Due to this we've chosen to remove the
sigar dependency and all sigar-based plugins from Ohai 13. There is no
anticipated impact for Chef Foundation Platforms or Secondary Platforms.
See the [Platforms](platforms.html) page for a complete list of
platforms.
