-   **Chef Workstation** is the location where users interact with Chef
    Infra. With Chef Workstation, users can author and test
    [cookbooks](/cookbooks/) using tools such as [Test
    Kitchen](/workstation/kitchen/) and interact with the Chef Infra Server
    using the [knife](/workstation/knife/) and [chef](/ctl_chef/) command
    line tools.
-   **Chef Infra Client nodes** are the machines that are managed by
    Chef Infra. The Chef Infra Client is installed on each node and is
    used to configure the node to its desired state.
-   **Chef Infra Server** acts as [a hub for configuration
    data](/server_overview/). Chef Infra Server stores cookbooks,
    the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes
    each registered node that is being managed by Chef. Nodes use the
    Chef Infra Client to ask the Chef Infra Server for configuration
    details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions.

Chef Infra Components
=====================

The following diagram shows the relationships between the various
elements of Chef Infra, including the nodes, the server, and the
workstation. These elements work together to provide the Chef Infra
Client the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do
its job. As you are reviewing the rest of this topic, use the icons in
the tables to refer back to this image.

Chef Infra Client run reporting, compliance reporting, high availability
configurations, and Chef Infra Server replication are available as part
of Chef Automate.

The following sections discuss these elements (and their various
components) in more detail.

Workstations
============

A workstation is your local computer running Chef Workstation that you
use to author cookbooks, interact with the Chef Infra Server, and
interact with nodes.

The workstation is where users do most of their work, including:

-   Developing and testing cookbooks and recipes
-   Testing Chef code
-   Keeping the Chef repository synchronized with version source control
-   Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and
    environments, and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags
-   Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a
    bootstrap operation

Chef Workstation Components and Tools

<li>Knife: Use the knife command-line tool to interact with nodes or work with objects on the Chef Infra Server</li>
<li>Chef Infra Client: an agent that configures your nodes</li>
<li>Test Kitchen: a testing harness for rapid validation of Chef code</li>
<li>Chef InSpec: Chef's open source security &amp; compliance automation framework</li>

Cookbooks
=========

{{% cookbooks_summary %}}

The Chef Infra Client uses Ruby as its reference language for creating
cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific
resources. A reasonable set of resources are available to the Chef Infra
Client, enough to support many of the most common infrastructure
automation scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when
additional resources and capabilities are required.

Components
----------

Cookbooks are comprised of the following components:

<p><img src="/images/icon_recipe_dsl.svg" class="align-center" width="100" alt="image" /></p></td>
<td><p>{{% cookbooks_recipe %}}</p>
<p>The Chef Infra Client will run a recipe only when asked. When the Chef Infra Client runs the same recipe more than once, the results will be the same system state each time. When a recipe is run against a system, but nothing has changed on either the system or in the recipe, the Chef Infra Client won't change anything.</p>

<tr class="even">

<td><p>{{% resources_common %}}</p>
<p>Chef has <a href="/resources/">many built-in resources</a> that cover all of the most common actions across all of the most common platforms. You can <a href="/custom_resources/">build your own resources</a> to handle any situation that isn't covered by a built-in resource.</p></td>

<tr class="even">

<td>Testing cookbooks improves the quality of those cookbooks by ensuring they are doing what they are supposed to do and that they are authored in a consistent manner. Unit and integration testing validates the recipes in cookbooks. Syntax testing---often called linting---validates the quality of the code itself. The following tools are popular tools used for testing Chef recipes: Test Kitchen, ChefSpec, and Cookstyle.</td>

Conclusion
==========

Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This
approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make
reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in
taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system,
plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of
the Ruby language. Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility
to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well as being able to
handle any customization path your organization requires.
