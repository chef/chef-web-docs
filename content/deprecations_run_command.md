The old run_command API has been replaced by shell_out (a wrapper
around Mixlib::ShellOut).

This deprecation warning was added in Chef Client 12.18.31, and
run_command will be removed permanently in Chef Client 13.

## Example

Previously to run a command from Chef Infra Client code you might have
written:

```ruby
run_command(command: '/sbin/ifconfig eth0')
```

## Remediation

You now need to use shell_out! instead:

```ruby
shell_out!('/sbin/ifconfig eth0')
```
