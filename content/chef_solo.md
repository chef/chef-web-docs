Cookbooks
=========

chef-solo supports two locations from which cookbooks can be run:

-   A local directory.
-   A URL at which a tar.gz archive is located.

Using a tar.gz archive is the more common approach, but requires that
cookbooks be added to an archive. For example:

``` bash
tar zcvf chef-solo.tar.gz ./cookbooks
```

If multiple cookbook directories are being used, chef-solo expects the
tar.gz archive to have a directory structure similar to the following:

    cookbooks/
      |---- cbname1/
        |--attributes/ ... etc
      ...
      |---- cbname2/
        |--attributes/

The `cookbook_path` variable in the solo.rb file must include both
directories. For example:

``` bash
tar zcvf chef-solo.tar.gz ./cookbooks ./site-cookbooks
```

When the tar.gz archive contains all of the cookbooks required by
chef-solo, upload it to the web server from which chef-solo will access
the archive.

Nodes
=====

Unlike Chef Infra Client, where the node object is stored on the Chef
Infra Server, chef-solo stores its node objects as JSON files on local
disk. By default, chef-solo stores these files in a `nodes` folder in
the same directory as your `cookbooks` directory. You can control the
location of this directory via the `node_path` value in your
configuration file.

Attributes
==========

chef-solo does not interact with the Chef Infra Server. Consequently,
node-specific attributes must be located in a JSON file on the target
system, a remote location (such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)),
or a web server on the local network.

The JSON file must also specify the recipes that are part of the
run-list. For example:

``` javascript
{
  "resolver": {
    "nameservers": [ "10.0.0.1" ],
    "search":"int.example.com"
  },
  "run_list": [ "recipe[resolver]" ]
}
```

Data Bags
=========

A data bag is defined using JSON. chef-solo will look for data bags in
`/var/chef/data_bags`, but this location can be modified by changing the
setting in solo.rb. For example, the following setting in solo.rb:

``` ruby
data_bag_path '/var/chef-solo/data_bags'
```

Create a data bag by creating folders. For example:

``` bash
mkdir /var/chef-solo/data_bags
```

and:

``` bash
mkdir /var/chef-solo/data_bags/admins
```

and then create a JSON file in that location:

``` javascript
{
  "id": "ITEM_NAME"
}
```

where the name of the file is the `ITEM_NAME`, for example:

``` ruby
/var/chef-solo/data_bags/admins/ITEM_NAME.json
```

Roles
=====

A role is defined using JSON or the Ruby DSL. chef-solo will look for
roles in `/var/chef/roles`, but this location can be modified by
changing the setting for `role_path` in solo.rb. For example, the
following setting in solo.rb:

``` ruby
role_path '/var/chef-solo/roles'
```

Role data looks like the following in JSON:

``` javascript
{
  "name": "test",
  "default_attributes": { },
  "override_attributes": { },
  "json_class": "Chef::Role",
  "description": "This is just a test role, no big deal.",
  "chef_type": "role",
  "run_list": [ "recipe[test]" ]
}
```

and like the following in the Ruby DSL:

``` ruby
name 'test'
description 'This is just a test role, no big deal.'
run_list 'recipe[test]'
```

and finally, JSON data passed to chef-solo:

``` ruby
{ 'run_list': 'role[test]' }
```
