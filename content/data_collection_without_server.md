Previous step: [Setup Data Collection](/data_collection/)

{{< /important >}}

If you do not use a Chef Infra Server in your environment (if you only
use `chef-solo`, for example), you can configure your Chef Infra Clients
to send their run data to Automate directly.

To enable this functionality, you must perform the following steps:

-   Configure a Data Collector token in Chef Automate (see [prior
    section](/data_collection/#step-1-configure-a-data-collector-token-in-chef-automate))
-   Add Chef Automate SSL certificate to `trusted_certs` directory
-   Configure Chef Infra Client to use the Data Collector endpoint in
    Chef Automate

Add Chef Automate certificate to `trusted_certs` directory
==========================================================

{{< note >}}

This step only applies to self-signed SSL certificates. If you are using
an SSL certificate signed by a valid certificate authority, you may skip
this step.

{{< /note >}}

Chef requires that the self-signed Chef Automate SSL certificate
(`HOSTNAME.crt`) is located in the `/etc/chef/trusted_certs` directory
on any node that wants to send data to Chef Automate. This directory is
the location into which SSL certificates are placed when a node has been
bootstrapped with Chef Infra Client.

To fetch the certificate onto your workstation, use `knife ssl fetch`
and pass in the URL of the Chef Automate server. You can then use
utilities such as `scp` or `rsync` to copy the downloaded cert files
from your `.chef/trusted_certs` directory to the
`/etc/chef/trusted_certs` directory on the nodes in your infrastructure
that will be sending data directly to the Chef Automate server.

Configure Chef Infra Client to use the Data Collector endpoint in Chef Automate
===============================================================================

{{< note >}}

Chef version 12.12.15 or greater is required.

{{< /note >}}

The data collector functionality is used by Chef Infra Client to send
node and converge data to Chef Automate. This feature works for the
following: Chef Infra Client, and both the default and legacy modes of
Chef solo.

To send node, converge, and compliance data to Chef Automate, modify
your Chef config (that is `client.rb`, `solo.rb`, or add an additional
config file in an appropriate directory, such as `client.d`) to contain
the following configuration:

``` ruby
data_collector.server_url "https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com/data-collector/v0/"
data_collector.token "TOKEN"
profiles['root_url'] = 'https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com'
```

where `my-automate-server.mycompany.com` is the fully-qualified domain
name of your Chef Automate server and `TOKEN` is the token value you
configured in the earlier step.
