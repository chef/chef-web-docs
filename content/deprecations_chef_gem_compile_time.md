+++

Originally, the [chef gem](/resources/chef_gem/) resource always ran
during the <span class="title-ref">compile</span> phase (see this
section on [Chef Infra Client
runs](/chef_client_overview/#the-chef-client-run) for further
details). It is now possible to control which phase the resource is run
in. Calling `chef_gem` without specifying the phase is now deprecated.

This deprecation warning was added in Chef Client 12.1.0, and using
`chef_gem` without specifying a phase will become an error in Chef
Client 13.

## Remediation

There are two possible remediations.

The first is to set the `compile_time` property on the resource. To
maintain the same behavior as before, the property should be set to
`true`:

```ruby
chef_gem 'etcd' do
  compile_time true
end
```

The second, and preferred, is to add a [gem
dependency](/config_rb_metadata/) in your cookbook metadata.

```ruby
gem 'etcd'
```
