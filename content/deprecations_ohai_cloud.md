In Ohai/Chef releases 13 we replaced the existing Cloud plugin with the
Cloud_v2 plugin. This was done by having the Cloud_v2 plugin populate
both `node['cloud']` and `node['cloud_v2']`. The Cloud_v2 plugin
includes a different data format that resolves many of the longstanding
bugs in the existing Cloud plugin.

## Remediation

If you have a cookbook that relies on data from `node['cloud']` you will
need to update the code to the new format in Chef Client 13. On a Chef
Client 12 or earlier node you can compare the data formats by running
`ohai cloud` and `ohai cloud_v2`.

Here are examples of the old and new format of the cloud data:

```javascript
{
  "public_ips": [
    "52.88.253.144"
  ],
  "private_ips": [
    "172.31.37.209"
  ],
  "public_ipv4": "52.88.253.144",
  "public_hostname": "ec2-52-88-253-144.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com",
  "local_ipv4": "172.31.37.209",
  "local_hostname": "ip-172-31-37-209.us-west-2.compute.internal",
  "provider": "ec2"
}
```

```javascript
{
  "public_ipv4_addrs": [
    "52.88.253.144"
  ],
  "local_ipv4_addrs": [
    "172.31.37.209"
  ],
  "public_hostname": "ec2-52-88-253-144.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com",
  "local_hostname": "ip-172-31-37-209.us-west-2.compute.internal",
  "public_ipv4": "52.88.253.144",
  "local_ipv4": "172.31.37.209",
  "provider": "ec2"
}
```
