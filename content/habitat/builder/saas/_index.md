Chef Habitat SaaS Builder is the cloud-hosted version of Habitat Builder, designed to simplify the process of building, storing, and promoting application packages across environments.
It provides a centralized platform where developers can upload Habitat plans, trigger builds, and manage package lifecycles without needing to maintain their own infrastructure.
Habitat SaaS Builder integrates with GitHub to automate builds and supports channels for promoting packages through development, staging, and production workflows.
