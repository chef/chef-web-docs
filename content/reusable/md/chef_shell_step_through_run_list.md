To explore how using the **breakpoint** to manually step through a Chef
Infra Client run, create a simple recipe in chef-shell:

```bash
chef > recipe_mode
  chef:recipe > echo off
  chef:recipe > file "/tmp/before-breakpoint"
  chef:recipe > breakpoint "foo"
  chef:recipe > file "/tmp/after-breakpoint"
```

and then run Chef Infra Client:

```bash
chef:recipe > run_chef
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:17:49 -0800] DEBUG: Processing file[/tmp/before-breakpoint]
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:17:49 -0800] DEBUG: file[/tmp/before-breakpoint] using Chef::Provider::File
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:17:49 -0800] INFO: Creating file[/tmp/before-breakpoint] at /tmp/before-breakpoint
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:17:49 -0800] DEBUG: Processing [./bin/../lib/chef/mixin/recipe_definition_dsl_core.rb:56:in 'new']
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:17:49 -0800] DEBUG: [./bin/../lib/chef/mixin/recipe_definition_dsl_core.rb:56:in 'new'] using Chef::Provider::Breakpoint
```

Chef Infra Client ran the first resource before the breakpoint
(`file[/tmp/before-breakpoint]`), but then stopped after execution. Chef
Infra Client attempted to name the breakpoint after its position in the
source file, but Chef Infra Client was confused because the resource was
entered interactively. From here, chef-shell can resume the interrupted
Chef Infra Client run:

```bash
chef:recipe > chef_run.resume
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:27:08 -0800] INFO: Creating file[/tmp/after-breakpoint] at /tmp/after-breakpoint
```

A quick view of the `/tmp` directory shows that the following files were
created:

```bash
after-breakpoint
before-breakpoint
```

You can rewind and step through a Chef Infra Client run:

```bash
chef:recipe > Chef::Log.level = :debug # debug logging won't turn on automatically in this case
    => :debug
  chef:recipe > chef_run.rewind
    => 0
  chef:recipe > chef_run.step
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:52 -0800] DEBUG: Processing file[/tmp/before-breakpoint]
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:52 -0800] DEBUG: file[/tmp/before-breakpoint] using Chef::Provider::File
    => 1
  chef:recipe > chef_run.step
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:54 -0800] DEBUG: Processing [./bin/../lib/chef/mixin/recipe_definition_dsl_core.rb:56:in 'new']
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:54 -0800] DEBUG: [./bin/../lib/chef/mixin/recipe_definition_dsl_core.rb:56:in 'new'] using Chef::Provider::Breakpoint
    => 2
  chef:recipe > chef_run.step
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:56 -0800] DEBUG: Processing file[/tmp/after-breakpoint]
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:40:56 -0800] DEBUG: file[/tmp/after-breakpoint] using Chef::Provider::File
    => 3
```

From the output, the rewound run-list is shown, but when the resources
are executed again, they will repeat their checks for the existence of
files. If they exist, Chef Infra Client will skip creating them. If the
files are deleted, then:

```bash
chef:recipe > ls("/tmp").grep(/breakpoint/).each {|f| rm "/tmp/#{f}" }
    => ["after-breakpoint", "before-breakpoint"]
```

Rewind, and then resume your Chef Infra Client run to get the expected
results:

```bash
chef:recipe > chef_run.rewind
  chef:recipe > chef_run.resume
  [Fri, 15 Jan 2020 14:48:56 -0800] DEBUG: Processing file[/tmp/before-breakpoint]
