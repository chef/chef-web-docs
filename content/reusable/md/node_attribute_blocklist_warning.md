When attribute blocklist settings are used, any attribute defined in a blocklist won't be saved to the Chef Infra Server and any attribute that isn't defined in a blocklist will be saved. Each attribute type must be blocklisted independently of the other attribute types. For example, if `blocked_automatic_attributes` defines attributes that won't be saved, but `blocked_normal_attributes`, `blocked_default_attributes`, and `blocked_override_attributes` aren't defined, then all normal attributes, default attributes, and override attributes will be saved, as well as the automatic attributes that weren't specifically excluded through blocklisting.
