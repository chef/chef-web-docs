When attribute allowlist settings are used, only the attributes defined in a allowlist will be saved and any attribute that is not defined in a allowlist will not be saved. Each attribute type is allowlisted independently of the other attribute types. For example, if `automatic_attribute_allowlist` defines attributes to be saved, but `normal_attribute_allowlist`, `default_attribute_allowlist`, and
`override_attribute_allowlist` are not defined, then all normal attributes, default attributes, and override attributes are saved, as well as the automatic attributes that were specifically included through allowlisting.
