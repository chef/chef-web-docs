JSON and YAML recipes let you define Chef Infra resources using a no-code syntax instead of Ruby. This feature makes Chef Infra recipes more accessible to users who prefer declarative YAML or JSON syntax over Ruby code.

YAML and JSON recipes simplify defining Chef resources for basic use cases. While they have significant limitations compared to Ruby recipes, they're valuable for teams that prefer YAML syntax and don't need advanced Chef DSL features. For complex scenarios involving dynamic logic, node attributes, or resource relationships, use Ruby recipes.

For most production environments, use a hybrid approach: YAML or JSON recipes for simple static configurations and Ruby recipes for complex logic. This approach balances simplicity and functionality.
