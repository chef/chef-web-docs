Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a feature of Windows PowerShell
that provides [a set of language extensions, cmdlets, and
resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview)
that can be used to declaratively configure software. DSC is similar to
Chef, in that both tools are idempotent, take similar approaches to the
concept of resources, describe the configuration of a system, and then
take the steps required to do that configuration. The most important
difference between Chef and DSC is that Chef uses Ruby and DSC is
exposed as configuration data from within Windows PowerShell.
