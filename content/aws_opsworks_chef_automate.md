[AWS OpsWorks for Chef
Automate](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/chefautomate/) is an AWS
service which you can use to create a Chef Automate instance.

For documentation on how to setup and create a new instance, please see
the [AWS OpsWorks User
Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/welcome_opscm.html).

For a tutorial on how to use your new Chef Automate instance, go to
[Manage a node with Chef
Automate](https://learn.chef.io/modules/manage-a-node-chef-automate/),
choose the platform you want to manage, then choose **AWS OpsWorks for
Chef Automate**.

Finally, the general Chef Automate documentation on this site applies to
the instances you create via OpsWorks for Chef Automate, so feel free to
refer to it as needed.

The following is applicable to any instances created with AWS OpsWorks
for Chef Automate.

Finding your AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate instance
====================================================

All of the Chef Automate instances created via AWS OpsWorks for Chef
Automate are named `aws-opsworks-cm-YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME`. In order to
access your Chef Automate instance, you can simply search for
`aws-opsworks-cm` in the AWS Management console.

Configuring AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate with runners
=======================================================

In order to add runners to your "AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate"
instance you need to do the following:

1.  Make sure you have selected `Use an existing EC2 key pair` in the
    `Select an SSH key` section while creating your AWS OpsWorks for
    Chef Automate instance. In order to add a runner, you need to SSH
    into your instance and run the
    [install-runner](/ctl_automate_server/#install-runner)
    subcommand.
2.  Your runner should be reachable via SSH from your Chef Automate
    instance. For this to succeed, you need to make sure its subnet,
    security groups, and SSH key pair are configured correctly. We also
    recommend setting up a dedicated SSH key pair in AWS and copying the
    private key to your Chef Automate instance and use it while running
    [install-runner](/ctl_automate_server/#install-runner) command.
3.  You can find the FQDN of your "AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate"
    instance in the OpsWorks console. You can use `ec2-user` as the
    username to SSH into your instance. Assuming you have configured the
    SSH keys correctly, the SSH command should look like
    `ssh ec2-user@<instance-name>-<random-chars>.gamma.opsworks-cm.io`.

Pushing a change through AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate
=======================================================

Existing documentation for pushing a change through Chef Automate is
applicable for AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. The only extra
configuration that you will need to do is to make sure you edit the
security group of your AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate instance to allow
inbound Git traffic (using the SSH protocol). This is required so that
you can create and approve changes in your Chef Automate instance. Once
you [find your Chef Automate
instance](#find-opsworks-instance) you
can go to the linked security group and add a new inbound rule.
