The `Chef::REST` class will be removed.

`Chef::REST` was deprecated in Chef Client 12.7.2, and will be removed
in Chef Client 13.

The [Cookstyle](/workstation/cookstyle.html) cop
[ChefDeprecations/UsesChefRESTHelpers](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/docs/cops_chefdeprecations.md#chefdeprecationsuseschefresthelpers)
has been introduced to detect this deprecation.

## Remediation

If writing code designed to be run internally to Chef, for example in a
cookbook or a knife plugin, transition to using `Chef::ServerAPI`. In
most cases this is as simple as creating a `Chef::ServerAPI` instance
rather than a `Chef::REST` one.

If writing code to interact with a Chef Infra Server from other code,
move to the [chef-api gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-api).
