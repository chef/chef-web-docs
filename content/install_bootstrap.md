## Minimum Recommended Recipe Run-List on a Node

You do not have to choose a complete recipe [run-list](/run_lists/) now if you are not sure which
recipes you want to bootstrap a node with. When running Chef Infra Client 15.x, at a minimum
we recommend adding the cron resource in the
[chef-client cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-client) to your run-list.
This will help you control how and when the `chef-client` command will run and
maintain your current configuration. Use the `-r` or `--run-list` option with the
[`knife bootstrap`](/workstation/knife_bootstrap/) subcommand to set a run-list on a node, for example `-r recipe[myrecipe::cron]`.


### Windows

By default, Windows systems will run the chef-client cookbook as a
scheduled task if your run-list looks like this: `recipe[chef-client::default]`.

### Unix-like Clients

Although it is not the default, you should configure Unix-like clients to run
the chef-client cookbook as a scheduled task using either cronjob or systemd.

**cronjob**

For simplicity's sake or if you are running Chef Infra Client
15.x, you should run a cronjob. Call the `chef_client_cron` resource
and set the `:add` action in your own recipe for your initial run-list.
In Chef Infra Client 16.x, do the same but you will not need the chef-client
cookbook as the resource is available natively.

**systemd**

Use systemd if you are already comfortable with it and it is available
and active on your system. For Chef Infra Client 15.x, choose the
`recipe[chef-client::default]` recipe for your initial
run-list and be sure the `node['chef_client']['systemd']['timer'] = true` attribute
is set. For Chef Infra Client 16.x, use the native `chef_client_systemd_timer`
resource with the `:add` action in your own recipe and set that recipe as your
initial run-list.

See the [chef-client cookbook repository](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client)
for more details on configuration.

## knife bootstrap

{{% install_chef_client %}}

**Run the bootstrap command**

The `knife bootstrap` subcommand is used to run a bootstrap operation
that installs Chef Infra Client on the target node. The following steps
describe how to bootstrap a node using knife.

1.  Identify the FQDN or IP address of the target node. The
    `knife bootstrap` command requires the FQDN or the IP address for
    the node in order to complete the bootstrap operation.

2.  Once the workstation machine is configured, it can be used to
    install Chef Infra Client on one (or more) nodes across the
    organization using a knife bootstrap operation. The
    `knife bootstrap` command is used to SSH into the target machine,
    and then do what is needed to allow Chef Infra Client to run on the
    node. It will install the Chef Infra Client executable (if
    necessary), generate keys, and register the node with the Chef Infra
    Server. The bootstrap operation requires the IP address or FQDN of
    the target system, the SSH credentials (username, password or
    identity file) for an account that has root access to the node, and
    (if the operating system is not Ubuntu, which is the default
    distribution used by `knife bootstrap`) the operating system running
    on the target system.

    In a command window, enter the following:

    ```bash
    knife bootstrap 172.16.1.233 -U USERNAME --sudo
    ```

    where `172.16.1.233` is the IP address or the FQDN for the node,
    and `USERNAME` is the username you want to use to connect, and
    `--sudo` specifies to elevate privileges using the sudo command
    on UNIX-based systems.

    Then while the bootstrap operation is running, the command
    window will show something similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Enter password for ubuntu@172.16.1.233:

    Connecting to 172.16.1.233
    Performing legacy client registration with the validation key at /Users/USERNAME/.chef/validator.pem...
    Delete your validation key in order to use your user credentials for client registration instead.

    ```

3.  After the bootstrap operation has finished, verify that the node is
    recognized by the Chef Infra Server. To show only the node that was
    just bootstrapped, run the following command:

    ```bash
    knife client show NAME_OF_NODE
    ```

    where `NODE_NAME` is the name of the node that was just
    bootstrapped. The Chef Infra Server will return something similar
    to:

    ```bash
    admin:     false
    chef_type: client
    name:      NODE_NAME
    validator: false
    ```

    and to show the full list of nodes (and workstations) that are
    registered with the Chef Infra Server, run the following command:

    ```bash
    knife client list
    ```

    The Chef Infra Server will return something similar to:

    ```bash
    workstation1
    workstation2
    ...
    client1
    client2
    ```

## Validatorless and Legacy Validator Bootstraps

We recommended using "validatorless bootstrapping" to authenticate new nodes with the Chef Infra Server.

The legacy Chef Infra validator-based node bootstrapping process depended on using a shared "validatory" key throughout an organization for authenticating new nodes with the Chef Infra Server.

Shortcomings of the legacy validator process are:

* All users share the same key for bootstrapping new systems
* Key sharing makes key rotation difficult, if it is compromised or if an employee leaves the organization.

The "validatorless bootstrap" generates a key for each node, which is then transferred to the new node and used to authenticate with the Chef Infra Server instead of relying on a shared "validator" key.

The Chef Infra bootstrap process is validatorless by default.
If you receive a warning during a bootstrap that a validator key is in use, remove the configuration for this legacy bootstrap mode.
Edit your [config.rb (knife.rb)](/workstation/config_rb/) file and remove any `validation_key` or `validation_client_name` entries.

## Bootstrapping with chef-vault

Use the following options with a validatorless bootstrap to specify
items that are stored in chef-vault:

`--bootstrap-vault-file VAULT_FILE`

:   The path to a JSON file that contains a list of vaults and items to
    be updated.

`--bootstrap-vault-item VAULT_ITEM`

:   A single vault and item to update as `vault:item`.

`--bootstrap-vault-json VAULT_JSON`

:   A JSON string that contains a list of vaults and items to be
    updated. --bootstrap-vault-json '{ "vault1": \["item1", "item2"\],
    "vault2": "item2" }'

## Examples

The `--bootstrap-vault-*` options add the client identify of the
bootstrapping node to the permissions list of the specified vault item.
This enables the newly-bootstrapped Chef Infra Client to be able to read
items from the vault. Only a single client is authorized at a time for
access to the vault. (The `-S` search query option with the
`knife vault create` subcommand does the same.)

### Recreate a data bag item

The following example shows how to recreate a data bag item:

```bash
knife vault delete sea power
Do you really want to delete sea/power? (Y/N) Y
Deleted chef_vault_item[sea/power]

echo "{\"some\":\"content for them\"}" > sea-power-content.json

cat sea-power-content.json
{"some":"content for them"}

knife vault create sea power -M client -A sean_horn,angle -J sea-power-content.json
```

No clients, because the `-S` option was not specified while creating the
vault.

At this time, only the users `sean_horn` and `angle` are authorized to
read and manage the vault.

```bash
knife vault show sea power  --mode client -p all
admins:
  sean_horn
  angle
clients:
id:           power
search_query:
some:         content for them
```

It is definitely an encrypted databag, see?

```bash
knife data_bag show sea power
WARNING: Encrypted data bag detected, but no secret provided for decoding.  Displaying encrypted data.
id:   power
some:
cipher:         aes-256-cbc

+yxL
iv:             ONoVR7OjPZiAzaqOZ30bjg==
version:        1
```

### Use --bootstrap-vault-file

Use the `sea:power` recreation step above first, to follow the
difference in the vault permissions.

```bash
echo "{\"sea\":\"power\"}" > sea-power-bootstrap-vault-file.json

knife bootstrap localhost -p 2200 -N ubuntu-20.04 -r 'role[group1]' --connection-user vagrant --sudo --bootstrap-vault-file sea-power-bootstrap-vault-file.json

```

The client `ubuntu-20.04` was added to the `chef-vault` during the
bootstrap.

```bash
knife vault show sea power  --mode client -p all
admins:
  sean_horn
  angle
clients:      ubuntu-20.04
id:           power
search_query:
some:         content for them
```

### Use --bootstrap-vault-item

Use the `sea:power` re-creation step above first, to follow the
difference in the vault permissions.

```bash
knife bootstrap localhost -p 2200 -N ubuntu-20.04 -r 'role[group1]' --connection-user vagrant --sudo --bootstrap-vault-item sea:power
Node ubuntu-20.04 exists, overwrite it? (Y/N) Y

localhost
localhost Running handlers:
localhost Running handlers complete
localhost Chef Client finished, 1/1 resources updated in 34.322229474
seconds
```

During the above run, the `sea:power` vault item was updated with the
`ubuntu-20.04` client during the validatorless bootstrap. Previously, it
only had the two admins authorized to view the content

```bash
knife vault show sea power -p all
admins:
  sean_horn
  angle
clients:      ubuntu-20.04
id:           power
search_query: role:stuff
some:         secret stuff for them
```

Then, let's check the `ubuntu-20.04` client. The client itself can decrypt and read
the encrypted databag contents as well using the embedded knife CLI in the Chef Infra
Client package.

```bash
sudo /opt/chef/bin/knife vault show sea power -c /etc/chef/client.rb -M client -p all
admins:
  sean_horn
  angle
clients:      ubuntu-20.04
id:           power
search_query: role:group1
some:         secret stuff for them
```

Success! The client is authorized to view the content of the `sea:power`
databag item

### Use --bootstrap-vault-json

Use the `sea:power` re-creation step above first, to follow the
difference in the vault permissions.

```bash
knife bootstrap localhost -p 2200 -N ubuntu-20.04 -r 'role[group1]' --connection-user vagrant --sudo --bootstrap-vault-json '{"sea": "power"}'

## Unattended Installs

Chef Infra Client can be installed using an unattended bootstrap. This
allows Chef Infra Client to be installed from itself, without requiring
SSH. For example, machines are often created using environments like AWS
Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, Rackspace Auto Scale, and PXE. In this
scenario, using tooling for attended, single-machine installs like
`knife bootstrap` or `knife CLOUD_PLUGIN create` is not practical
because the machines are created automatically and someone cannot always
be on-hand to initiate the bootstrap process.

When Chef Infra Client is installed using an unattended bootstrap,
remember that Chef Infra Client:

- Must be able to authenticate to the Chef Infra Server
- Must be able to configure a run-list
- May require custom attributes, depending on the cookbooks that are being used
- Must be able to access the chef-validator.pem so that it may create a new identity on the Chef Infra Server
- Must have a unique node name; Chef Infra Client will use the FQDN for the host system by default

When Chef Infra Client is installed using an unattended bootstrap, it
may be built into an image that starts Chef Infra Client on boot, or
installed using User Data or some other kind of post-deployment script.
The type of image or User Data used depends on the platform on which the
unattended bootstrap will take place.

### Bootstrapping with User Data

The method used to inject a user data script into a server will vary
depending on the infrastructure platform being used. For example, on AWS
you can pass this data in as a text file using the command line tool.

The following user data examples demonstrate the process of
bootstrapping Windows and Linux nodes.

#### PowerShell User Data

It is important that settings in the [client.rb
file](/config_rb_client/)---`chef_server_url`, `http_proxy`, and so
on are used---to ensure that configuration details are built into the
unattended bootstrap process.
