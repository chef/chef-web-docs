chef-docs hopes that the documentation is always just what you are
looking for, but when that is not the case we do appreciate
feedback. There are several ways to get feedback to chef-docs. For
members of the Chef community, customers, or people who just want to
send feedback, choose any of the following options:

## Feedback Form

Every page in [docs.chef.io](https://docs.chef.io) has a feedback form
at the bottom of the page. Please feel free to include any thoughts or
suggestions for improving the documentation on a page. Be as detailed as possible.

Use the feedback form at the bottom of this page for submitting general feedback
about Chef's documentation.

These forms are not for customer support. If you need support,
contact [Chef support](https://supportlink.chef.io/).

## Email

Send an email to <chef-docs@progress.com> for documentation bugs,
ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. This email address is
not a support email address, however. If you need support,
contact [Chef support](https://supportlink.chef.io/).

## GitHub Issues

Open an issue in <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/issues>
on GitHub. If you believe the issue may be a product bug within a Chef
itself, consider opening an issue in the relevant [product repository]({{< relref "repositories" >}}).

## GitHub Pull Request

You can open a pull request on <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs>.
Every page on <https://docs.chef.io> has a link to the Markdown page in the repository
that it's sourced from. We require a DCO sign-off to submit pull requests
except for obvious fixes. See our
[Contributing page](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certification-of-origin-dco)
for more information about our DCO policy. If you have questions about the
chef-web-docs repo, send an email to <chef-docs@progress.com> and we're
happy to assist.

Thanks in advance for any feedback you choose to send.
