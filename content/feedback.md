[\[edit on GitHub\]](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/content/feedback.md)

chef-docs hopes that the documentation is always just what you are
looking for, but when that isn't the case chef-docs does appreciate
feedback. There are several ways to get feedback to chef-docs. For
members of the Chef community, customers, or people who just want to
send feedback, choose any of the following four options:

-   Email --- Send an email to <docs@chef.io> for documentation bugs,
    ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. Typos and little errors and quick
    fixes will be fixed quickly and without fuss. This email address is
    not a support email address, however. If you need support for Chef,
    contact Chef support.
-   GitHub issues --- Use the
    <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/issues> in the chef-docs repo
    on GitHub. If you believe the issue may be a product bug within Chef
    itself, consider using <https://github.com/chef/chef/issues> to
    raise the issue.
-   GitHub pull request -- The documentation repository is on GitHub:
    <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs>. We require a DCO sign-off
    to submit pull requests to this repo except for obvious fixes. See
    our [Contributing
    page](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certification-of-origin-dco)
    for more information about our DCO policy. If you have questions
    about the chef-docs repo, send an email to <docs@chef.io> and we're
    happy to assist.
-   <https://discourse.chef.io> --- chef-docs follows the discussions at
    <https://discourse.chef.io>. Improvements to the documentation are
    made because of conversations that happen on this mailing list. That
    said, relying solely on the mailing list is the least effective way
    to get feedback to chef-docs (because there is no guarantee that
    chef-docs will see any particular message).

For internal members of Chef, to provide feedback about
already-published content, a pull request or issue in GitHub is
recommended unless the change is minor (sentence structure, typo, quick
suggestion).

Thanks in advance for any feedback you choose to send.
