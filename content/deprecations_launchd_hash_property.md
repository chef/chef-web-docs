+++

The launchd resource has a property called `hash` which conflicts with
the already-existing Ruby `hash` method that exists on every object.

The [CHEF-11](/deprecations_property_name_collision/) deprecation
warns whenever a resource property is named the same as an existing Ruby
method. Chef's core `launchd` resource is guilty of this behavior. The
`hash` property accepts a Ruby Hash containing the data to be output to
the launchd property list. However, `hash` is an already-existing Ruby
method.

A deprecation warning is logged when the `hash` property is used. In
Chef Client 13, this will raise an exception and your Chef run will
fail.

The [Cookstyle](/workstation/cookstyle/) cop
[ChefDeprecations/LaunchdDeprecatedHashProperty](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/blob/master/docs/cops_chefdeprecations.md#chefdeprecationslaunchddeprecatedhashproperty)
has been introduced to detect and autocorrect this deprecation.

## Remediation

When using the `launchd` resource and passing a hash for the launchd
property list, use the `plist_hash` property instead of the `hash`
property.
