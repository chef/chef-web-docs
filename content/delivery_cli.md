The Delivery CLI is the command-line interface for the workflow
capabilities in Chef Automate. It sits in-between a local git repository
and the Chef Automate server.

Install Delivery CLI
====================

{{% delivery_cli_install %}}

Configure Delivery CLI
======================

{{% delivery_cli_configure %}}

Run Delivery CLI in FIPS Mode
=============================

{{% fips_intro %}}

See the main [FIPS documentation](/fips/) for more information on
what FIPS is and how to enable it.

**Initialize project with Bitbucket repository**

{{% delivery_cli_init_bitbucket_project %}}

**Initialize project with GitHub repository**

To initialize a project using a GitHub repository, run a command similar
to:

``` bash
delivery init --github ORG_NAME -r REPO_NAME
```

where `ORG_NAME` is the name of the GitHub organization and `REPO_NAME`
is the name of the repository in GitHub. For example to initialize the
`seapower` repository in GitHub with the `chef-cookbooks` organization:

``` bash
delivery init --github chef-cookbooks -r seapower
```

and returns output similar to:

``` bash
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from /Users/albertatom/chef/delivery/organizations/sandbox/seapower

**Add build-cookbook from private Supermarket**

The following example shows how to add a build cookbook after the
initialization process

``` bash
delivery init -skip-build-cookbook
```

and then update the `config.json` file for the `delivery-truck` cookbook
and the path to the cookbook in a private Chef Supermarket:

``` javascript
{
  "version": "2",
  "build_cookbook": {
    "name": "delivery-truck",
    "supermarket": "true",
    "site": "https://private-supermarket.example.com"
  },
  ...
}
```

**Initialize project with custom pipeline**

To initialize a project using a GitHub repository, run a command similar
to:

``` bash
delivery init --generator PATH_TO_COOKBOOK -c PATH_TO_CONFIG -f PIPELINE
```

where `PATH_TO_COOKBOOK` is path to the cookbook generator,
`PATH_TO_CONFIG` is the path to a `config.json` file, and `PIPELINE` is
the name of a pipeline in Chef Automate. For example to initialize a
pipeline using the `bc-generator` cookbook generator and the `trunk`
pipeline:

``` bash
delivery init --generator https://github.com/albertatom/bc-generator.git -c /Users/albertatom/chef/delivery/.delivery/config.json -f trunk
```

returns output similar to:

``` bash

delivery job
============

Use the `job` subcommand to execute a Chef Automate phase. This command
starts two Chef Infra Client runs: the first is based on the default
recipe in a build cookbook and the second is based on the specified Chef
Automate phase.

Syntax
------

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
delivery job STAGE PHASE (options)
```

where:

-   `STAGE` is a stage in the Chef Automate pipeline: Verify, Build,
    Acceptance, Union, Rehearsal, Delivered
-   `PHASE` is a phase, which runs recipes, in a Chef Automate stage

Options
-------

This subcommand has the following options:

`-b=BRANCH`, `--branch=BRANCH`

    certificate authority or a self-signed certificate.

`-g=URL`, `--git-url=URL`

:   The raw git URL for the specified project. This URL is used as the
    remote target for the local git checkout when the job is run. If
    this option is used, the `--ent`, `--org`, `--server`, and `--user`
    options are ignored.

`-j=PATH`, `--job-root=PATH`

:   The path to the job root.

`-l`, `--local`

To run your unit tests on your local machine the same way they'd be run
on Chef Automate, run the following command:

``` bash
delivery job verify unit --local
```

which will return output similar to:

``` bash
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from /Users/adam/src/opscode/delivery/opscode/delivery-cli

```

delivery local
==============

Use the `local` subcommand to run Delivery phase or stage on your local
Chef Workstation installation, based on settings in the `project.toml`
file located in the project's `.delivery` directory.

Syntax
------

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
delivery local PHASE|STAGE
```

where `PHASE` is one of the following:

-   lint
-   syntax
-   unit
-   provision
-   deploy
-   smoke
-   functional
-   cleanup

and `STAGE` will execute a series of phases in the following order: \*
verify: \[lint, syntax, unit\] \* acceptance: \[provision, deploy,
smoke, functional, cleanup\] \* all: \[lint, syntax, unit, provision,
deploy, smoke, functional, cleanup\]

Configuration
-------------

**Phases**

Phases are defined in the `project.toml` file in the following format:

``` ruby
[local_phases]
name_of_phase = "command to execute locally"
```

Example configuration for commands to run locally:

``` ruby
[local_phases]
unit = "rspec spec/"
lint = "cookstyle"
syntax = "echo skipping syntax phase"
```

**Remote project.toml**

You can use a `project.toml` file located in a remote location by
specifying a URI in the following format:

``` ruby
remote_file = "https://url-for-my-project.toml"
```

This is useful for teams that wish to centrally manage the behavior of
the `delivery local` command across many different projects.
Alternatively, you can provide the URI via the `-r` flag:

``` bash
delivery local syntax -r https://url-for-my-project.toml
```

Providing the URI through this manner will take precedence over anything
configured in the local `project.toml`.

Examples
--------

**Run Cookstyle**

If the `project.toml` file contains:

``` ruby
unit = "rspec spec/"
lint = "cookstyle --only ChefCorrectness"
syntax = "echo skipping syntax phase"
provision = "kitchen create"
deploy = "kitchen converge"
smoke = "kitchen verify"
cleanup = "kitchen destroy"
```

the command

``` bash
delivery local lint
```

will run Cookstyle and execute the following command locally:

``` bash
cookstyle --only ChefCorrectness
```

**Run Verify Stage**

If the `project.toml` file contains:

``` ruby
unit = "rspec spec/"
lint = "cookstyle --only ChefCorrectness"
syntax = "echo skipping syntax phase"
provision = "kitchen create"
deploy = "kitchen converge"
smoke = "kitchen verify"
cleanup = "kitchen destroy"
```

the command

``` bash
delivery local lint
```

will run lint, syntax and unit phases in that order:

``` bash
Chef Delivery
Running Lint Phase
Inspecting 45 files
.............................................

45 files inspected, no offenses detected
```

delivery review
===============

Use the `review` subcommand to submit a feature branch for review as a
new patchset. This either creates a new change associated with the
feature branch, or adds a new patchset on an existing change in the
pipeline. When the new patchset has been created, the Verify stage for
the associated change is automatically triggered and runs the unit, lint
and syntax phases. By default, this action opens a browser window to
show the pipeline in Chef Automate.

Syntax
------

This subcommand has the following syntax:

``` bash
delivery review (options)
```

Options
-------

This subcommand has the following options:

`-a`, `--auto-bump`

:   Bumps the cookbook metadata version number automatically when
    `delivery review` is run.

`--edit`

:   Edit the title and description for the change.

`--fips`

:   Runs command in FIPS mode. This proxies all git traffic through
    Stunnel FIPS encryption.

`--fips-git-port=PORT`

:   The port Stunnel listens locally on when proxying git traffic.

`--fips-custom-cert-filename=PATH_TO_PEM`

:   The path to a pem file that contains a self-signed certificate or
    certificate chain. Use this setting only when you have a custom
    certificate authority or a self-signed certificate.

`--no-open`

:   Prevent opening a browser that shows the pipeline in Chef Automate
    web UI.

`--pipeline=PIPELINE`

:   The name of a Chef Automate pipeline.

Examples
--------

**Bump version metadata automatically**

``` bash
delivery review --auto-bump
```

will return something similar to:

``` none
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from /Users/albertatom/delivery/organizations/sandbox/coffee
