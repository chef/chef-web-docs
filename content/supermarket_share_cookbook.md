This guide will show you how to share a cookbook on the public [Chef
Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/). The public Supermarket uses
[Hosted Chef](https://manage.chef.io), the Chef-as-a-service provider,
for user authentication. You will need a Hosted Chef account to share
cookbooks.

{{< note >}}

If you already use Hosted Chef as your Chef Infra Server, skip to the
cookbook sharing method of your choice:

-   [Stove](/supermarket_share_cookbook/#share-cookbooks-via-stove)
-   [Knife](/supermarket_share_cookbook/#share-cookbooks-via-knife)

{{< /note >}}

## Create a Hosted Chef Account

1.  Go to the [Hosted Chef signup page](https://manage.chef.io/signup)
    and enter the requested information to create your account.

2.  You will receive a confirmation email. Use the link in the email to
    confirm your confirm your email address.

3.  Log in to Hosted Chef and click the **Create New Organization**
    button:

4.  Download and extract the Hosted Chef starter kit:

## Share Cookbooks via Stove

[Stove](https://github.com/chef/stove) is a cookbook release
utility that keeps the upload process localized to the cookbook itself,
as opposed to the
[Knife](/supermarket_share_cookbook/#share-cookbooks-via-knife)
method which requires a cookbook repository.

{{< note >}}

Stove is included in Chef Workstation. If you are not using Chef
Workstation, follow the [Stove installation
instructions](https://github.com/chef/stove) to
install Stove separately.

{{< /note >}}

1.  Add your Hosted Chef credentials to Stove. Replace `USER` with your
    Hosted Chef user, and `KEY.pem` with your the full path to Hosted
    Chef private key:

    ```none
    stove login --username USER --key ~/chef-repo/.chef/KEY.pem
    ```

    Stove will save this information to its configuration file under
    `~/.stove`. Note that if you've downloaded the Hosted Chef starter
    kit, the private key is located within its chef-repo under
    `/chef-repo/.chef/USERNAME.pem`.

2.  Navigate to the root of the cookbook that you want to upload, then
    initialize Stove:

    ```none
    stove
    ```

    Stove will package the cookbook, tag the cookbook version, and
    publish it to the public Supermarket. By default, Stove will tag the
    current commit of the Git repo with the version number declared in
    the cookbook's metadata, and will push that tag to the Git remote;
    Use `stove --no-git` to disable this feature.

## Share Cookbooks via Knife

Use the [knife supermarket](/workstation/knife_supermarket/) command to upload
cookbooks to the Supermarket via Knife. In this section you'll configure
the chef-repo that was created by the Hosted Chef starter kit, and then
upload cookbooks from your workstation's cookbook repository.

{{< note >}}

If you're using Hosted Chef as your regular Chef Infra Server, skip to
the second step.

{{< /note >}}

1.  The `config.rb` file located under `/chef-repo/.chef/config.rb`
    contains the basic information necessary to authenticate with Hosted
    Chef. It will look similar to the following:

    ```ruby
    current_dir = __dir__
    log_level                :info
    log_location             STDOUT
    node_name                'brewn'
    client_key               "#{current_dir}/brewn.pem"
    chef_server_url          'https://api.chef.io/organizations/chfex'
    cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]
    ```

    However if you're not an existing Hosted Chef user, you've most
    likely created your cookbooks within another repository with its own
    Knife configuration. Instead of modifying your workstation setup,
    simply add the path to your cookbook repository under the
    `cookbook_path` setting in your Hosted Chef chef-repo. For example:

    ```ruby
    cookbook_path            ['~/my-repo/cookbooks']
    ```

2.  Use the `knife supermarket` command to upload your cookbook to the
    Supermarket:

    ```none
    knife supermarket share example_cookbook
    ```

    Alternatively, if you chose not to modify the location of your
    cookbook repository within your `config.rb`, you can specify the
    cookbook path in your `knife` command:

    ```none
    knife supermarket share example_cookbook -o ~/my-repo/cookbooks
    ```
