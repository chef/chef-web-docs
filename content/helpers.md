Helper classes enable users to share code between Custom Resources. Rspec method test are possible when code is abstracted into plain Ruby files.

## Example

To include the following helper from `libraries/helpers.rb`

```ruby
#libraries/helpers.rb
module Haproxy
  module cookbook
    module ResourceHelpers
      def haproxy_version
        version = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("haproxy -v | grep version | awk '{ print $3 }'")
        version.run_command.stdout.to_f
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Within a Custom Resource file, use the include directive in the action_class, to include all methods in the specified module.

```ruby
action_class do
  include Haproxy::Cookbook::ResourceHelpers
end
```
