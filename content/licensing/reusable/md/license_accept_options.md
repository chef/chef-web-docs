`accept`
: Accept the license and attempts to persist a marker file locally. Persisting these marker files means future invocations don't require accepting the license again.

`accept-silent`
: Similar to `accept`, but no messaging is sent to STDOUT.

`accept-no-persist`
: Similar to `accept-silent`, but no marker file is persisted. Future invocation will require accepting the license again.
