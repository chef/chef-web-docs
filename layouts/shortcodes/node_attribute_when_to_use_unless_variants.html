Another (much less common) approach is to set a value only if an
attribute has no value. This can be done by using the `_unless` variants
of the attribute priority methods:

-   `default_unless`

-   `set_unless` (`normal_unless` is an alias of `set_unless`; use
    either alias to set an attribute with a normal attribute
    precedence.)

-   `override_unless`

Use the `_unless` variants carefully (and only when necessary) because
when they are used, attributes applied to nodes may become out of sync
with the values in the cookbooks as these cookbooks are updated. This
approach can create situations where two otherwise identical nodes end
up having slightly different configurations and can also be a challenge
to debug.
