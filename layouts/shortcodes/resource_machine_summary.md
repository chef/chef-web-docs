Use the **machine** resource to define one (or more) machines, and then
converge entire clusters of machines. This allows clusters to be
maintained in a version control system and to be defined using
multi-machine orchestration scenarios. For example, spinning up small
test clusters and using them for continuous integration and local
testing, building clusters that auto-scale, moving a set of machines in
one cluster to another, building images, and so on.

Each machine is declared as a separate application topology, defined
using operating system- and provisioner-independent files. Recipes
(defined in cookbooks) are used to manage them. Chef Infra Client is
used to converge the individual nodes (machines) within the cluster.
