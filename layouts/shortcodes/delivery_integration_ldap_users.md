Integrating Chef Automate with your LDAP system allows you to
automatically add more user details and authenticate users against your
existing identity management system. However, even once your LDAP system
has been integrated to Chef Automate, you must manually add users. If
you are going to add a user in your integrated LDAP system to Chef
Automate, you must have their LDAP name.
