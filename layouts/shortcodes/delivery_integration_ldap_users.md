Integrating Workflow with your LDAP system allows you to automatically
add more user details and authenticate users against your existing
identity management system. However, even once your LDAP system has been
integrated to Workflow, you must manually add users. If you are going to
add a user in your integrated LDAP system to Workflow, you must have
their LDAP name.
