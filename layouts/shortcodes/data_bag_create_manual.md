One or more data bags and data bag items can be created manually under
the `data_bags` directory in the chef-repo. Any method can be used to
create the data bag folders and data bag item JSON files. For example:

```bash
mkdir data_bags/admins
```

would create a data bag folder named "admins". The equivalent command
for using knife is:

```bash
knife data bag create admins
```

A data bag item can be created manually in the same way as the data bag,
but by also specifying the file name for the data bag item (this example
is using vi, a visual editor for UNIX):

```bash
vi data_bags/admins/charlie.json
```

would create a data bag item named "charlie.json" under the "admins"
sub-directory in the `data_bags` directory of the chef-repo. The
equivalent command for using knife is:

```bash
knife data bag create admins charlie
```
