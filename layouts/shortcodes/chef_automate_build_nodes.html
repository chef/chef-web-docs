Legacy build nodes created by `delivery-cluster` can be used with a Chef
Automate server. Some node visibility features are designed to only work
with new build nodes and runners installed through the command line
process, but the workflow feature in Chef Automate can use legacy, new,
or mixed node pools; however, you cannot upgrade a legacy build node to
the new build node or runner models. If you would like to use new build
nodes/runners, please use fresh hosts or completely wipe your legacy
build nodes before attempting to run `automate-ctl install-build-node`
or `automate-ctl install-runner`.
