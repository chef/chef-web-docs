This resource has the following properties:

`chef_server`

:   **Ruby Type:** Hash

    The URL for the Chef Infra Server.

`content`

:   A string that is written to the file. The contents of this property
    replace any previous content when this property has something other
    than the default value. The default behavior will not modify
    content.

`driver`

:   **Ruby Type:** Chef::Provisioning::Driver

    Use to specify the driver to be used for provisioning.

`group`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    A string or ID that identifies the group owner by group name,
    including fully qualified group names such as `domain\group` or
    `group@domain`. If this value is not specified, existing groups
    remain unchanged and new group assignments use the default `POSIX`
    group (if available).

`local_path`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    The local path to a file.

`machine`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    Use to specify the machine type.

`mode`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    If `mode` is not specified and if the file already exists, the
    existing mode on the file is used. If `mode` is not specified, the
    file does not exist, and the `:create` action is specified, Chef
    Infra Client assumes a mask value of `'0777'` and then applies the
    umask for the system on which the file is to be created to the
    `mask` value. For example, if the umask on a system is `'022'`, Chef
    Infra Client uses the default value of `'0755'`.

    The behavior is different depending on the platform.

    UNIX- and Linux-based systems: A quoted 3-5 character string that
    defines the octal mode that is passed to chmod. For example:
    `'755'`, `'0755'`, or `00755`. If the value is specified as a quoted
    string, it works exactly as if the `chmod` command was passed. If
    the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (`0`) to the
    value to ensure that it is interpreted as an octal number. For
    example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users,
    use `'0777'` or `'777'`; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit,
    use `01777` or `'1777'`.

    Microsoft Windows: A quoted 3-5 character string that defines the
    octal mode that is translated into rights for Microsoft Windows
    security. For example: `'755'`, `'0755'`, or `00755`. Values up to
    `'0777'` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in Microsoft
    Windows as they do in UNIX, where `4` equals `GENERIC_READ`, `2`
    equals `GENERIC_WRITE`, and `1` equals `GENERIC_EXECUTE`. This
    property cannot be used to set `:full_control`. This property has no
    effect if not specified, but when it and `rights` are both
    specified, the effects are cumulative.
