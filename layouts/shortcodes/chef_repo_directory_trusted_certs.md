The `/.chef/trusted_certs` directory stores trusted SSL certificates
used to access the Chef Infra Server:

-   On each workstation, this directory is the location into which SSL
    certificates are placed after they are downloaded from the Chef
    Infra Server using the `knife ssl fetch` subcommand
-   On every node, this directory is the location into which SSL
    certificates are placed when a node has been bootstrapped with Chef
    Infra Client from a workstation
