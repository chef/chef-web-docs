Use of a `response_file` is only supported on Debian and Ubuntu at this
time. Custom resources must be written to support the use of a
`response_file`, which contains debconf answers to questions normally
asked by the package manager on installation. Put the file in
`/files/default` of the cookbook where the package is specified and Chef
Infra Client will use the **cookbook_file** resource to retrieve it.

To install a package with a `response_file`:

``` ruby
package 'sun-java6-jdk' do
  response_file 'java.seed'
end
```
