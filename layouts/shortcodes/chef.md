Chef Infra is a powerful automation platform that transforms
infrastructure into code. Whether you're operating in the cloud,
on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef Infra automates how
infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network,
no matter its size.

This diagram shows how you develop, test, and deploy your Chef Infra
code.
