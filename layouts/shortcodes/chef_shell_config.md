chef-shell determines which configuration file to load based on the
following:

1.  If a configuration file is specified using the `-c` option,
    chef-shell will use the specified configuration file
2.  When chef-shell is started using a named configuration as an
    argument, chef-shell will search for a chef-shell.rb file in that
    directory under `~/.chef`. For example, if chef-shell is started
    using `production` as the named configuration, the chef-shell will
    load a configuration file from `~/.chef/production/chef_shell.rb`
3.  If a named configuration is not provided, chef-shell will attempt to
    load the chef-shell.rb file from the `.chef` directory. For example:
    `~/.chef/chef_shell.rb`
4.  If a chef-shell.rb file is not found, chef-shell will attempt to
    load the client.rb file
5.  If a chef-shell.rb file is not found, chef-shell will attempt to
    load the solo.rb file
