If an organization does not have any nodes associated with it, it does
not show up in the **Nodes** section of the Chef Automate UI. This is
also true for roles, cookbooks, recipes, attributes, resources, node
names, and environments. Only those items that have a node associated
with them will appear in the UI. Chef Automate has all the data for all
of these, but does not highlight them in the UI. This is designed to
keep the UI focused on the nodes in your cluster.
