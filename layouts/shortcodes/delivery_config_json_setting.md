The behavior of pipeline phases can be customized using the project's
`config.json` file. Each `config.json` file has a set of required
settings as well as optional settings that can be set, such as which
build nodes to use for specific phases, whether to skip certain phases,
and so on. The basic settings are defined below; however, additional
settings, such as which linting rules to follow, can also be added. See
the [delivery-truck
readme](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/README.md)
for examples on how to add custom settings.
