Use `.run_action(:some_action)` at the end of a resource block to run
the specified action during the compile phase. For example:

``` ruby
resource_name 'foo' do
  action :nothing
end.run_action(:some_action)
```

where `action` is set to `:nothing` to ensure the `run_action` is run
during the compile phase and not later during the execution phase.

The following examples show when (and when not) to use `run_action`.

**Update a package cache**

Sometimes it is necessary to ensure that an operating system's package
cache is up to date before installing packages. For example, on Debian
or Ubuntu systems, the Apt cache should be updated:

``` ruby
if node['apt']['compile_time_update'] && ( !::File.exist?('/var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp') || !::File.exist?(first_run_file) )
  e = bash 'apt-get-update at compile time' do
    code <<-EOH
      apt-get update
      touch #{first_run_file}
    EOH
    ignore_failure true
    only_if { apt_installed? }
    action :nothing
  end
  e.run_action(:run)
end
```

where `e.run_action(:run)` tells Chef Infra Client to run the
`apt-get update` command during the compile phase. This example can be
found in the `default.rb` recipe of the [apt
cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/apt) that is maintained by
Chef.

**Use the chef_gem resource for Ruby gems**

A very common use case is to install a gem during the compile phase so
that it will be available to Chef Infra Client during the execution
phase. This is why the **chef_gem** resource exists. For example, this:

``` ruby
chef_gem 'foo' do
  action :install
end
```

is effectively the same as

``` ruby
gem_package 'foo' do
  action :nothing
end.run_action(:install)
Gem.clear_paths
```

but without needing to define a `run_action`.

**Notifications will not work**

Resources that are executed during the compile phase cannot notify other
resources. For example:

``` ruby
execute 'ifconfig'

p = package 'vim-enhanced' do
  action :nothing
  notifies :run, 'execute[ifconfig]', :immediately
end
p.run_action(:install)
```

A better approach in this type of situation is to install the package
before the resource collection is built to ensure that it is available
to other resources later on.
