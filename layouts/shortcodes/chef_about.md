Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This
approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make
reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in
taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system,
plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of
the Ruby language. Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility
to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well as being able to
handle any customization path your organization requires.
