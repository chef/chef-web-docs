The `knife windows` subcommand is used to configure and interact with
nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running
Microsoft Windows. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows native
objects---batch scripts, Windows PowerShell scripts, or scripting
library variables---to be called by external applications. The
`knife windows` subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of
authentication.
