Configuration data in DSC scripts may be customized from a recipe. For
example, scripts are typically customized to set the behavior for
Windows PowerShell credential data types. Configuration data may be
specified in one of three ways:

-   By using the `configuration_data` attribute
-   By using the `configuration_data_script` attribute
-   By specifying the path to a valid Windows PowerShell data file
