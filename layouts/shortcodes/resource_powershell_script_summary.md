Use the **powershell_script** resource to execute a script using the
Windows PowerShell interpreter, much like how the **script** and
**script**-based resources---**bash**, **csh**, **perl**, **python**,
and **ruby**---are used. The **powershell_script** is specific to the
Microsoft Windows platform and the Windows PowerShell interpreter.

The **powershell_script** resource creates and executes a temporary
file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather than
running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this
resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically
unique to the environment in which they are run. Use `not_if` and
`only_if` to guard this resource for idempotence.
