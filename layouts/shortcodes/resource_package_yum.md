Use the **yum_package** resource to install, upgrade, and remove
packages with Yum for the Red Hat and CentOS platforms. The
**yum_package** resource is able to resolve `provides` data for
packages much like Yum can do when it is run from the command line. This
allows a variety of options for installing packages, like minimum
versions, virtual provides, and library names.
