The Chef Infra Server uses organizations, groups, and users to define
role-based access control:

<td>An organization is the top-level entity for role-based access control in the Chef Infra Server. Each organization contains the default groups (<code>admins</code>, <code>clients</code>, and <code>users</code>, plus <code>billing_admins</code> for the hosted Chef Infra Server), at least one user and at least one node (on which the Chef Infra Client is installed). The Chef Infra Server supports multiple organizations. The Chef Infra Server includes a single default organization that is defined during setup. Additional organizations can be created after the initial setup and configuration of the Chef Infra Server.</td>

<td><p>A group is used to define access to object types and objects in the Chef Infra Server and also to assign permissions that determine what types of tasks are available to members of that group who are authorized to perform them. Groups are configured per-organization.</p>
<p>Individual users who are members of a group will inherit the permissions assigned to the group. The Chef Infra Server includes the following default groups: <code>admins</code>, <code>clients</code>, and <code>users</code>. For users of the hosted Chef Infra Server, an additional default group is provided: <code>billing_admins</code>.</p></td>

<td>A user is any non-administrator human being who will manage data that is uploaded to the Chef Infra Server from a workstation or who will log on to the Chef management console web user interface. The Chef Infra Server includes a single default user that is defined during setup and is automatically assigned to the <code>admins</code> group.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><img src="/images/icon_chef_client.svg" class="align-center" width="100" alt="image" /></td>
<td>A client is an actor that has permission to access the Chef Infra Server. A client is most often a node (on which the Chef Infra Client runs), but is also a workstation (on which knife runs), or some other machine that is configured to use the Chef Infra Server API. Each request to the Chef Infra Server that is made by a client uses a private key for authentication that must be authorized by the public key on the Chef Infra Server.</td>
