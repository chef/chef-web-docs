In order to add or edit users, you must have root shell access and the
**Admin** role assigned in Workflow.

To edit LDAP details for a user:

1.  Log into the Workflow web UI as an administrator.

2.  Select **Users** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

    The **Users** list page opens. You can use the search filter in the
    upper right corner to make sure that the user is not already added.

3.  Click the plus sign (**+**) next to **Add a New User**.

4.  In the **Add New a User** text area, select one of two types for
    user. The selection box is grey for the active selection.

    **Internal** means you are manually adding the user to the Delivery
    database.

    **LDAP** means the user is in an LDAP system that has been
    integrated to this Workflow.

    If you select **Internal**, options for **Name and Email**, first
    name, last name, email address, and **Security Information**, a
    login name and password, appear.

    If you select **LDAP**, the **Name and Email** options go away and a
    **Security Information** option for the user's LDAP username
    appears.

5.  Enter the appropriate information for the type of user you are
    adding. Leave the **SSH Public Key** area blank. The user must log
    in and enter this information.

    Select user **Roles Within the Enterprise**.

    Click **Save and Close**, or **Cancel** to discard the operation.

    The **User** list page opens and a status message appears.

To check that the user was added properly when using LDAP, click
**Edit** and verify that the user details are present.
