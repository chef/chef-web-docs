A driver-specific resource is a statement of configuration policy that:

-   Describes the desired state for a configuration item that is created
    using Chef Provisioning
-   Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
-   Specifies a resource type---such as `package`, `template`, or
    `service`
-   Lists additional details (also known as properties), as necessary
-   Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations
