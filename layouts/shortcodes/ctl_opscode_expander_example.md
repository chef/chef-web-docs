For example, to view the aggregate queue backlog, enter the following:

``` bash
$ cd /opt/opscode/embedded/service/opscode-expander/
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/opscode/bin:/opt/opscode/embedded/bin
$ bin/opscode-expander-ctl queue-depth
```

to return something similar to:

``` bash
total messages:       0
average queue depth:  0.0
max queue depth:      0
min queue depth:      0
```
