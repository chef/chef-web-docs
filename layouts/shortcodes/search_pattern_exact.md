An exact matching search pattern is used to search for a key with a name
that exactly matches a search query. If the name of the key contains
spaces, quotes must be used in the search pattern to ensure the search
query finds the key. The entire query must also be contained within
quotes, so as to prevent it from being interpreted by Ruby or a command
shell. The best way to ensure that quotes are used consistently is to
quote the entire query using single quotes (' ') and a search pattern
with double quotes (" ").
