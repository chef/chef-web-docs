Using multiple organizations within the Chef Infra Server ensures that
the same toolset, coding patterns and practices, physical hardware, and
product support effort is being applied across the entire company, even
when:

-   Multiple product groups must be supported---each product group can
    have its own security requirements, schedule, and goals
-   Updates occur on different schedules---the nodes in one organization
    are managed completely independently from the nodes in another
-   Individual teams have competing needs for object and object
    types---data bags, environments, roles, and cookbooks are unique to
    each organization, even if they share the same name
