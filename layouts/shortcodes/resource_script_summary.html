Use the **script** resource to execute scripts using a specified
interpreter, such as Bash, csh, Perl, Python, or Ruby. This resource may
also use any of the actions and properties that are available to the
**execute** resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are
(by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the
environment in which they are run. Use `not_if` and `only_if` to guard
this resource for idempotence.

<div class="alert-info">

The **script** resource is different from the **ruby_block** resource
because Ruby code that is run with this resource is created as a
temporary file and executed like other script resources, rather than run
inline.
