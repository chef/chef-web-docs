A recipe can define specific behaviors for specific Microsoft Windows
platform versions by using a series of helper methods. To enable these
helper methods, add the following to a recipe:

``` ruby
require 'chef/win32/version'
```

Then declare a variable using the `Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version`
class:

``` ruby
variable_name = Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version.new
```

And then use this variable to define specific behaviors for specific
Microsoft Windows platform versions. For example:

``` ruby
if variable_name.helper_name?
  # Ruby code goes here, such as
  resource_name do
    # resource block
  end

elsif variable_name.helper_name?
  # Ruby code goes here
  resource_name do
    # resource block for something else
  end

else variable_name.helper_name?
  # Ruby code goes here, such as
  log 'log entry' do
    level :level
  end

end
```
