In certain situations Chef Provisioning will run multiple **machine**
processes in-parallel, as long as each of the individual **machine**
resources have the same declared action. The **machine_batch** resource
is used to run in-parallel processes.

Chef Provisioning will processes resources in-parallel automatically,
unless:

-   The recipe contains complex scripts, such as when a **file**
    resource sits in-between two **machine** resources in a single
    recipe. In this situation, the resources will be run sequentially
-   The actions specified for each individual **machine** resource are
    not identical; for example, if resource A is set to `:converge` and
    resource B is set to `:destroy`, then they may not be processed
    in-parallel

To disable in-parallel processing, add the `auto_machine_batch` setting
to the client.rb file, and then set it to `false`.

For example, a recipe that looks like:

``` ruby
machine 'a'
machine 'b'
machine 'c'
```

will show output similar to:

``` bash
$ CHEF_DRIVER=fog:AWS chef-apply cluster.rb
...

At the end, it shows `1/1 resources updated`. The three **machine**
resources are replaced with a single **machine_batch** resource, which
then runs each of the individual **machine** processes in-parallel.
