A `case` statement can be used to handle a situation where there are a
lot of conditions. Use the `when` statement for each condition, as many
as are required.

For example, using a `case` statement with the `platform` node
attribute:

``` ruby
case node['platform']
when 'debian', 'ubuntu'
  # do debian/ubuntu things
when 'redhat', 'centos', 'fedora'
  # do redhat/centos/fedora things
end
```

For example, using a `case` statement with the `platform_family` node
attribute:

``` ruby
case node['platform_family']
when 'debian'
  # do things on debian-ish platforms (debian, ubuntu, linuxmint)
when 'rhel'
  # do things on RHEL platforms (redhat, centos, scientific, etc)
end
```
