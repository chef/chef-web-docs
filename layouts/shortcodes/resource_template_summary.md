Use the **template** resource to manage the contents of a file using an
Embedded Ruby (ERB) template by transferring files from a sub-directory
of `COOKBOOK_NAME/templates/` to a specified path located on a host that
is running Chef Infra Client. This resource includes actions and
properties from the **file** resource. Template files managed by the
**template** resource follow the same file specificity rules as the
**remote_file** and **file** resources.
