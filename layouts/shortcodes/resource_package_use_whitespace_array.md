The following examples show different ways of doing the same thing. The
first shows a series of packages that will be upgraded:

``` ruby
package 'package-a' do
  action :upgrade
end

package 'package-b' do
  action :upgrade
end

package 'package-c' do
  action :upgrade
end

package 'package-d' do
  action :upgrade
end
```

and the next uses a single **package** resource and a whitespace array
(`%w`):

``` ruby
package %w{package-a package-b package-c package-d} do
  action :upgrade
end
```
