<div class="alert-info">

To enable Chef Automate to upload cookbooks to a private Supermarket,
you have to manually log into the Supermarket server with the `delivery`
user, and when it prompts you to enable the user for Supermarket, enter
`yes`. Also, you must copy the Supermarket certificate file to
`/etc/delivery/supermarket.crt` on the Chef Automate server.
