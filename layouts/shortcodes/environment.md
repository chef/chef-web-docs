An environment is a way to map an organization's real-life workflow to
what can be configured and managed when using Chef Infra Server. Every
organization begins with a single environment called the `_default`
environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional
environments can be created to reflect each organization's patterns and
workflow. For example, creating `production`, `staging`, `testing`, and
`development` environments. Generally, an environment is also associated
with one (or more) cookbook versions.
