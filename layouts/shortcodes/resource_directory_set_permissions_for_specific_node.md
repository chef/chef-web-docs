The following example shows how permissions can be set for the
`/certificates` directory on any node that is running Nginx. In this
example, permissions are being set for the `owner` and `group`
properties as `root`, and then read/write permissions are granted to the
root.

``` ruby
directory "#{node[:nginx][:dir]}/shared/certificates" do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  recursive true
end
```
