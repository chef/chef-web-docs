Using the **dsc_resource** has the following requirements:

-   Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 February Preview (or higher),
    which includes Windows PowerShell 5.0.10018.0 (or higher).

-   The `RefreshMode` configuration setting in the Local Configuration
    Manager must be set to `Disabled`.

    **NOTE:** Starting with the Chef Client 12.6 release, this
    requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier
    than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework
    (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented Chef Infra Client
    from running in non-disabled refresh mode.

-   The **dsc_script** resource may not be used in the same run-list
    with the **dsc_resource**. This is because the **dsc_script**
    resource requires that `RefreshMode` in the Local Configuration
    Manager be set to `Push`, whereas the **dsc_resource** resource
    requires it to be set to `Disabled`.

    **NOTE:** Starting with the Chef Client 12.6 release, this
    requirement applies only for versions of Windows PowerShell earlier
    than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of Windows Management Framework
    (WMF) 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented Chef Infra Client
    from running in non-disabled refresh mode, which allows the Local
    Configuration Manager to be set to `Push`.

-   The **dsc_resource** resource can only use binary- or script-based
    resources. Composite DSC resources may not be used.

    This is because composite resources aren't "real" resources from the
    perspective of the Local Configuration Manager (LCM). Composite
    resources are used by the "configuration" keyword from the
    `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` module, and then evaluated in that
    context. When using DSC to create the configuration document (the
    Managed Object Framework (MOF) file) from the configuration command,
    the composite resource is evaluated. Any individual resources from
    that composite resource are written into the Managed Object
    Framework (MOF) document. As far as the Local Configuration Manager
    (LCM) is concerned, there is no such thing as a composite resource.
    Unless that changes, the **dsc_resource** resource and/or
    `Invoke-DscResource` command cannot directly use them.
