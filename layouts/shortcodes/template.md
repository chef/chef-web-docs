A cookbook template is an Embedded Ruby (ERB) template that is used to
dynamically generate static text files. Templates may contain Ruby
expressions and statements, and are a great way to manage configuration
files. Use the **template** resource to add cookbook templates to
recipes; place the corresponding Embedded Ruby (ERB) template file in a
cookbook's `/templates` directory.
