Use the **batch** resource to execute a batch script using the cmd.exe
interpreter on Windows. The **batch** resource creates and executes a
temporary file (similar to how the **script** resource behaves), rather
than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this
resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically
unique to the environment in which they are run. Use `not_if` and
`only_if` to guard this resource for idempotence.
