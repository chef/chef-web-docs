The following example shows how to get the contents of a data bag item
named `impossible_things`, create a .pem file located at
`some/directory/path/`, and then use the `content` attribute to update
the contents of that file with the value of the `impossible_things` data
bag item:

``` ruby
private_key = data_bag_item('impossible_things', private_key_name)['private_key']

file "some/directory/path/#{private_key_name}.pem" do
  content private_key
  owner 'root'
  group 'group'
  mode '0755'
end
```
