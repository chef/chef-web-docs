The **template** resource can be used to render a template based on
settings contained in a local file on disk or to get the settings from a
template in a cookbook. Most of the time, the settings are retrieved
from a template in a cookbook. The following example shows how the
**template** resource can be used to retrieve these settings from a
local file.

The following example is based on a few assumptions:

-   The environment is a Ruby on Rails application that needs render a
    file named `database.yml`
-   Information about the application---the user, their password, the
    server---is stored in a data bag on the Chef server
-   The application is already deployed to the system and that only
    requirement in this example is to render the `database.yml` file

The application source tree looks something like:

    myapp/
    -> config/
       -> database.yml.erb

<div class="alert-info">

There should not be a file named `database.yml` (without the `.erb`), as
the `database.yml` file is what will be rendered using the **template**
resource.

</div>

The deployment of the app will end up in `/srv`, so the full path to
this template would be something like
`/srv/myapp/current/config/database.yml.erb`.

The content of the template itself may look like this:

``` ruby
<%= @rails_env %>:
   adapter: <%= @adapter %>
   host: <%= @host %>
   database: <%= @database %>
   username: <%= @username %>
   password: <%= @password %>
   encoding: 'utf8'
   reconnect: true
```

The recipe will be similar to the following:

``` ruby
results = search(:node, "role:myapp_database_master AND chef_environment:#{node.chef_environment}")
db_master = results[0]

template '/srv/myapp/shared/database.yml' do
  source '/srv/myapp/current/config/database.yml.erb'
  local true
  variables(
    :rails_env => node.chef_environment,
    :adapter => db_master['myapp']['db_adapter'],
    :host => db_master['fqdn'],
    :database => "myapp_#{node.chef_environment}",
    :username => "myapp",
    :password => "SUPERSECRET",
  )
end
```

where:

-   the `search` method in the Recipe DSL is used to find the first node
    that is the database master (of which there should only be one)
-   the `:adapter` variable property may also require an attribute to
    have been set on a role, which then determines the correct adapter

The template will render similar to the following:

``` ruby
production:
  adapter: mysql
  host: domU-12-31-39-14-F1-C3.compute-1.internal
  database: myapp_production
  username: myapp
  password: SUPERSECRET
  encoding: utf8
  reconnect: true
```

This example showed how to use the **template** resource to render a
template based on settings contained in a local file. Some other issues
that should be considered when using this type of approach include:

-   Should the `database.yml` file be in a `.gitignore` file?
-   How do developers run the application locally?
-   Does this work with chef-solo?
