The following example will delete the `/tmp/file` symbolic link and uses
the `only_if` guard to run the `test -L` command, which verifies that
`/tmp/file` is a symbolic link, and then only deletes `/tmp/file` if the
test passes:

``` ruby
link '/tmp/file' do
  action :delete
  only_if 'test -L /tmp/file'
end
```
