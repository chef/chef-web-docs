When a user makes a request to the Chef Infra Server using the Chef
Infra Server API, permission to perform that action is determined by the
following process:

1.  Check if the user has permission to the object type
2.  If no, recursively check if the user is a member of a security group
    that has permission to that object
3.  If yes, allow the user to perform the action

Permissions are managed using the Chef management console add-on in the
Chef Infra Server web user interface.
