The mdadm command can be used to create RAID arrays. For example, a RAID
5 array named `/dev/sd0` with 4, and a superblock type of `0.90` would
be similar to:

``` ruby
mdadm '/dev/sd0' do
  devices [ '/dev/s1', '/dev/s2', '/dev/s3', '/dev/s4' ]
  level 5
  metadata '0.90'
  chunk 32
  action :create
end
```
