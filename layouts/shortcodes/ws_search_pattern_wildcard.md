A wildcard matching search pattern is used to query for substring
matches that replace zero (or more) characters in the search pattern
with anything that could match the replaced character. There are two
types of wildcard searches:

-   A question mark (`?`) can be used to replace exactly one character
    (as long as that character is not the first character in the search
    pattern)
-   An asterisk (`*`) can be used to replace any number of characters
    (including zero)
