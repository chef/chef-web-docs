The following settings are often modified from the default as part of
the tuning effort for the **opscode-erchef** service:

`opscode_erchef['db_pool_size']`

:   The number of open connections to PostgreSQL that are maintained by
    the service. If failures indicate that the **opscode-erchef**
    service ran out of connections, try increasing the
    `postgresql['max_connections']` setting. If failures persist, then
    increase this value (in small increments) and also increase the
    value for `postgresql['max_connections']`. Default value: `20`.

`opscode_erchef['s3_url_ttl']`

:   The amount of time (in seconds) before connections to the server
    expire. If Chef Infra Client runs are timing out, increase this
    setting to `3600`, and then adjust again if necessary. Default
    value: `900`.

`opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`

Use to specify that search results only return objects to which an actor
(user, client, etc.) has read access, as determined by ACL settings.
This affects all searches. When `true`, the performance of the Chef
management console may increase because it enables the Chef management
console to skip redundant ACL checks. To ensure the Chef management
console is configured properly, after this setting has been applied with
a `chef-server-ctl reconfigure` run `chef-manage-ctl reconfigure` to
ensure the Chef management console also picks up the setting. Default
value: `false`.

Warning

</div>

When `true`, `opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']` affects all
search results and any actor (user, client, etc.) that does not have
read access to a search result will not be able to view it. For example,
this could affect search results returned during a Chef Infra Client
runs if a Chef Infra Client does not have permission to read the
information.
