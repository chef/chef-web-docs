A single instance of the Chef Infra Server can support many
organizations. Each organization has a unique set of groups and users.
Each organization manages a unique set of nodes, on which a Chef Infra
Client is installed and configured so that it may interact with a single
organization on the Chef Infra Server.

A user may belong to multiple organizations under the following
conditions:

-   Role-based access control is configured per-organization
-   For a single user to interact with the Chef Infra Server using knife
    from the same chef-repo, that user may need to edit their config.rb
    file prior to that interaction
