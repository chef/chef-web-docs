Use the **directory** resource to manage a directory, which is a
hierarchy of folders that comprises all of the information stored on a
computer. The root directory is the top-level, under which the rest of
the directory is organized. The **directory** resource uses the `name`
property to specify the path to a location in a directory. Typically,
permission to access that location in the directory is required.
