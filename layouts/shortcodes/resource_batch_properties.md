The batch resource has the following properties:

`architecture`

:   **Ruby Type:** Symbol

    The architecture of the process under which a script is executed. If
    a value is not provided, Chef Infra Client defaults to the correct
    value for the architecture, as determined by Ohai. An exception is
    raised when anything other than `:i386` is specified for a 32-bit
    process. Possible values: `:i386` (for 32-bit processes) and
    `:x86_64` (for 64-bit processes).

`code`

:   **Ruby Type:** String \| `REQUIRED`

    A quoted (" ") string of code to be executed.

`command`

:   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

    The name of the command to be executed.

`creates`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already
    exists.

`cwd`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    The current working directory from which the command will be run.

`flags`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    One or more command line flags that are passed to the interpreter
    when a command is invoked.

`group`

:   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

    The group name or group ID that must be changed before running a
    command.

`guard_interpreter`

:   **Ruby Type:** Symbol \| **Default Value:** `:batch`

    When this property is set to `:batch`, the 64-bit version of the
    cmd.exe shell will be used to evaluate strings values for the
    `not_if` and `only_if` properties. Set this value to `:default` to
    use the 32-bit version of the cmd.exe shell.

`interpreter`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    The script interpreter to use during code execution. Changing the
    default value of this property is not supported.

`returns`

:   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array \| **Default Value:** `0`

    The return value for a command. This may be an array of accepted
    values. An exception is raised when the return value(s) do not
    match.

`timeout`

:   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Float \| **Default Value:** `3600`

    The amount of time (in seconds) a command is to wait before timing
    out.

`user`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    The user name of the user identity with which to launch the new
    process. The user name may optionally be specified with a domain,
    i.e. <span class="title-ref">domainuser</span> or <span
    class="title-ref">user@my.dns.domain.com</span> via Universal
    Principal Name (UPN)format. It can also be specified without a
    domain simply as user if the domain is instead specified using the
    <span class="title-ref">domain</span> attribute. On Windows only, if
    this property is specified, the <span
    class="title-ref">password</span> property must be specified.

`password`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    *Windows only*: The password of the user specified by the <span
    class="title-ref">user</span> property. This property is mandatory
    if <span class="title-ref">user</span> is specified on Windows and
    may only be specified if <span class="title-ref">user</span> is
    specified. The <span class="title-ref">sensitive</span> property for
    this resource will automatically be set to true if password is
    specified.

`domain`

:   **Ruby Type:** String

    *Windows only*: The domain of the user user specified by the <span
    class="title-ref">user</span> property. If not specified, the user
    name and password specified by the <span
    class="title-ref">user</span> and <span
    class="title-ref">password</span> properties will be used to resolve
    that user against the domain in which the system running Chef Infra
    Client is joined, or if that system is not joined to a domain it
    will resolve the user as a local account on that system. An
    alternative way to specify the domain is to leave this property
    unspecified and specify the domain as part of the <span
    class="title-ref">user</span> property.
