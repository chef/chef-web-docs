The following example shows how to create a system user. In this
instance, the `home` value is calculated and stored in a variable called
`user_home` which sets the user's `home` attribute.

``` ruby
user_home = "/home/#{node['cookbook_name']['user']}"

user node['cookbook_name']['user'] do
  gid node['cookbook_name']['group']
  shell '/bin/bash'
  home user_home
  system true
  action :create
end
```
