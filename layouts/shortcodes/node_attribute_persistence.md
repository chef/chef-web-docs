At the beginning of a Chef Infra Client run, all attributes except for
normal attributes are reset. Chef Infra Client rebuilds them using
automatic attributes collected by Ohai at the beginning of each Chef
Infra Client run and then using default and override attributes that are
specified in cookbooks or by roles and environments. All attributes are
then merged and applied to the node according to attribute precedence.
At the conclusion of each Chef Infra Client run, the attributes that
were applied to the node are saved to the Chef Infra Server as part of
the node object.
