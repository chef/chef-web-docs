``` ruby
directory "C:\\tmp\\something" do
  rights :full_control, "DOMAIN\\User"
  inherits false
  action :create
end
```

or:

``` ruby
directory 'C:\tmp\something' do
  rights :full_control, 'DOMAIN\User'
  inherits false
  action :create
end
```

The difference between the two previous examples is the single- versus
double-quoted strings, where if the double quotes are used, the
backslash character (`\`) must be escaped using the Ruby escape
character (which is a backslash).
