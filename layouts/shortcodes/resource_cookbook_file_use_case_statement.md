The following example shows how a case statement can be used to handle a
situation where an application needs to be installed on multiple
platforms, but where the install directories are different paths,
depending on the platform:

``` ruby
cookbook_file 'application.pm' do
  path case node['platform']
    when 'centos','redhat'
      '/usr/lib/version/1.2.3/dir/application.pm'
    when 'arch'
      '/usr/share/version/core_version/dir/application.pm'
    else
      '/etc/version/dir/application.pm'
    end
  source "application-#{node['languages']['perl']['version']}.pm"
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
end
```
