Chef Infra Client can be installed on machines running Microsoft Windows
in the following ways:

-   By using [knife windows](/knife_windows/) to bootstrap Chef
    Infra Client; this process requires the target node be available via
    the WinRM port (typically port 5985)
-   By downloading Chef Infra Client to the target node, and then
    running the Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) locally
-   By using an existing process already in place for managing Microsoft
    Windows machines, such as System Center
