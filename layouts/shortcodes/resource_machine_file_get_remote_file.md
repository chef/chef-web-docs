A deployment process requires more than just setting up machines. For
example, files may need to be copied to machines from remote locations.
The following example shows how to use the **remote_file** resource to
grab a tarball from a URL, create a machine, copy that tarball to the
machine, and then get that machine running by using a recipe that
installs and configures that tarball on the machine:

``` ruby
remote_file 'mytarball.tgz' do
  url 'https://myserver.com/mytarball.tgz'
end

machine 'x'
  action :allocate
end

machine_file '/tmp/mytarball.tgz' do
  machine 'x'
  local_path 'mytarball.tgz'
  action :upload
end

machine 'x' do
  recipe 'untarthatthing'
  action :converge
end
```
