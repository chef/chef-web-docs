Use the **chef_handler** resource to enable handlers during a Chef
Infra Client run. The resource allows arguments to be passed to Chef
Infra Client, which then applies the conditions defined by the custom
handler to the node attribute data collected during a Chef Infra Client
run, and then processes the handler based on that data.

The **chef_handler** resource is typically defined early in a node's
run-list (often being the first item). This ensures that all of the
handlers will be available for the entire Chef Infra Client run.

**New in Chef Client 14.0.**
