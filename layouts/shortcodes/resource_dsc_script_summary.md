Many DSC resources are comparable to built-in Chef resources. For
example, both DSC and Chef have **file**, **package**, and **service**
resources. The **dsc_script** resource is most useful for those DSC
resources that do not have a direct comparison to a resource in Chef,
such as the `Archive` resource, a custom DSC resource, an existing DSC
script that performs an important task, and so on. Use the
**dsc_script** resource to embed the code that defines a DSC
configuration directly within a Chef recipe.
