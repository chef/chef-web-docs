-   Describes the desired state for a configuration item
-   Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
-   Specifies a resource type---such as `package`, `template`, or
    `service`
-   Lists additional details (also known as resource properties), as
    necessary
-   Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations
