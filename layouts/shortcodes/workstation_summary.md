A workstation is a computer running Chef Workstation that is used to
author cookbooks, interact with the Chef Infra Server, and interact with
nodes.

The workstation is where users do most of their work, including:

-   Developing and testing cookbooks and recipes
-   Testing Chef code
-   Keeping the Chef repository synchronized with version source control
-   Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and
    environments, and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags
-   Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a
    bootstrap operation
