A node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine that is configured to
be maintained by a Chef Infra Client. In order to bootstrap a node, you
will first need a working installation of the [Chef software
package](/packages/). A bootstrap installs Chef Infra Client on a
target system so that it can run as a client and communicate with Chef
Infra Server. There are two ways to do this:

-   Use the `knife bootstrap` subcommand to [bootstrap a node using the
    Chef installer](/install_bootstrap/)
-   Use an unattended install to bootstrap a node from itself, without
    using SSH or WinRM
