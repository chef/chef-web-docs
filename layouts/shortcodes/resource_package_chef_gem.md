Use the **chef_gem** resource to install a gem only for the instance of
Ruby that is dedicated to Chef Infra Client. When a gem is installed
from a local file, it must be added to the node using the
**remote_file** or **cookbook_file** resources.

The **chef_gem** resource works with all of the same properties and
options as the **gem_package** resource, but does not accept the
`gem_binary` property because it always uses the `CurrentGemEnvironment`
under which Chef Infra Client is running. In addition to performing
actions similar to the **gem_package** resource, the **chef_gem**
resource does the following:

-   Runs its actions immediately, before convergence, allowing a gem to
    be used in a recipe immediately after it is installed
-   Runs `Gem.clear_paths` after the action, ensuring that gem is aware
    of changes so that it can be required immediately after it is
    installed
