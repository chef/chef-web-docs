When running knife in Microsoft Windows, an ampersand (`&`) is a special
character and must be protected by quotes when it appears in a command.
The number of quotes to use depends on the shell from which the command
is being run.

When running knife from the command prompt, an ampersand should be
surrounded by quotes (`"&"`). For example:

``` bash
$ knife bootstrap windows winrm -P "&s0meth1ng"
```

When running knife from Windows PowerShell, an ampersand should be
surrounded by triple quotes (`"""&"""`). For example:

``` bash
$ knife bootstrap windows winrm -P """&s0meth1ng"""
```
