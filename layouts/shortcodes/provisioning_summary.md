Chef Provisioning is a collection of resources that enable the creation
of machines and machine infrastructures using Chef Infra Client. It has
a plugin model that allows bootstrap operations to be done against any
infrastructure, such as VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, Amazon EC2, LXC, bare
metal, and more.

Chef Provisioning is built around two major components: the **machine**
resource and drivers.

Chef Provisioning is packaged in ChefDK. Chef Provisioning is a
framework that allows clusters to be managed by Chef Infra Client and
the Chef Infra Server in the same way nodes are managed: with recipes.
Use Chef Provisioning to describe, version, deploy, and manage clusters
of any size and complexity using a common set of tools.
