RSA public key-pairs are used to authenticate Chef Infra Client with the
Chef Infra Server every time a Chef Infra Client needs access to data
that is stored on the Chef Infra Server. This prevents any node from
accessing data that it shouldn't and it ensures that only nodes that are
properly registered with the Chef Infra Server can be managed.
