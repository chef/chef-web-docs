The following example specifies a directory, and then uses the `content`
property to add a string to the file created in that directory:

``` ruby
status_file = '/path/to/file/status_file'

file status_file do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  content 'My favourite foremost coastal Antarctic shelf, oh Larsen B!'
end
```
