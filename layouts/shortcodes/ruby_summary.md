Ruby is a simple programming language:

-   Chef uses Ruby as its reference language to define the patterns that
    are found in resources, recipes, and cookbooks
-   Use these patterns to configure, deploy, and manage nodes across the
    network

Ruby is also a powerful and complete programming language:

-   Use the Ruby programming language to make decisions about what
    should happen to specific resources and recipes
-   Extend Chef in any manner that your organization requires
