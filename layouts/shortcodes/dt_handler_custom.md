A custom handler can be created to support any situation. The easiest
way to build a custom handler:

1.  Download the **chef_handler** cookbook
2.  Create a custom handler
3.  Write a recipe using the **chef_handler** resource
4.  Add that recipe to a node's run-list, often as the first recipe in
    that run-list
