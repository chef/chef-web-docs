The list of automatic attributes that are collected by Ohai at the start
of each Chef Infra Client run vary from organization to organization,
and will often vary between the various server types being configured
and the platforms on which those servers are run. All attributes
collected by Ohai are unmodifiable by Chef Infra Client. To see which
automatic attributes are collected by Ohai for a particular node, run
the following command:

``` bash
find  /opt/chefdk/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/*/gems/ohai-*/lib -name "*.rb" -print | xargs grep -R "provides" -h |sed 's/^\s*//g'|sed "s/\\\"/\'/g"|sort|uniq|grep "\sprovides"
```
