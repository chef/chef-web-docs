The Delivery CLI is required for the workstation and for many Chef
Automate functions. It is included in ChefDK and can be obtained by
[installing the latest version](/install_dk/).

<div class="alert-info">

You must delete your old Delivery CLI if you installed it prior to it
being included in ChefDK.
