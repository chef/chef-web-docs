One (or more) 60 character segments that comprise the canonical header.
A canonical header is signed with the private key used by the client
machine from which the request is sent, and is also encoded using
Base64. If more than one segment is required, each should be named
sequentially, e.g. `X-Ops-Authorization-1`, `X-Ops-Authorization-2`,
`X-Ops-Authorization-N`, where `N` represents the integer used by the
last header that is part of the request.
