A [resource](/resource/) defines the desired state for a single
configuration item present on a node that is under management by Chef. A
resource collection---one (or more) individual resources---defines the
desired state for the entire node. During a [Chef Infra Client
run](/chef_client.html#the-chef-client-run.html), the current state of
each resource is tested, after which Chef Infra Client will take any
steps that are necessary to repair the node and bring it back into the
desired state.
