Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are federal standards
for computer systems used by contractors of government agencies and
non-military government agencies.

FIPS 140-2 is a specific federal government security standard used to
approve cryptographic modules. Chef Automate uses the OpenSSL FIPS
Object Module, which satisfies the requirements of software
cryptographic modules under the FIPS 140-2 standard. The OpenSSL Object
Module provides an API for invoking FIPS approved cryptographic
functions from calling applications.
