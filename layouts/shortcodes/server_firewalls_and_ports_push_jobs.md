TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10002. TCP/10000 is the default heartbeat
port. TCP/10002 is the command port. It may be configured in the Chef
Push Jobs configuration file . This port allows Chef Push Jobs clients
to communicate with the Chef Push Jobs server. In a configuration with
both front and back ends, this port only needs to be open on the back
end servers. The Chef Push Jobs server waits for connections from the
Chef Push Jobs client, and never initiates a connection to a Chef Push
Jobs client.
