Chef Infra Client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is
under management by Chef Infra Server. When a Chef Infra Client is run,
it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node
into the expected state, including:

-   Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server
-   Building the node object
-   Synchronizing cookbooks
-   Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required
    cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
-   Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
-   Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required
