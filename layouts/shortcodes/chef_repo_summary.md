The chef-repo is the repository structure in which cookbooks are
authored, tested, and maintained:

-   Cookbooks contain recipes, attributes, custom resources, libraries,
    files, templates, tests, and metadata
-   The chef-repo should be synchronized with a version control system
    (such as git), and then managed as if it were source code
