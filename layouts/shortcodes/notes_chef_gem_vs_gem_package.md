The **chef_gem** and **gem_package** resources are both used to
install Ruby gems. For any machine on which Chef Infra Client is
installed, there are two instances of Ruby. One is the standard,
system-wide instance of Ruby and the other is a dedicated instance that
is available only to Chef Infra Client. Use the **chef_gem** resource
to install gems into the instance of Ruby that is dedicated to Chef
Infra Client. Use the **gem_package** resource to install all other
gems (i.e. install gems system-wide).
