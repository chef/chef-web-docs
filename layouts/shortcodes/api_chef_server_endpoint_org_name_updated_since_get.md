The `GET` method is used to return the details of an organization as
JSON.

**Request**

``` none
GET /organizations/NAME/objects_since?seq=NUM
```

where `NUM` is the largest integer previously returned as an identifier.

**Response**

The response will return an array of paths for objects that have been
created, updated, or deleted since `NUM`, similar to:

``` javascript
[
  {
    "action": "create",
    "id": 1,
    "path": "/roles/foo"
  },
  {
    "action": "create",
    "id": 2,
    "path": "/roles/foo2"
  },
  {
    "action": "create",
    "id": 3,
    "path": "/roles/foo3"
  },
  {
    "action": "update",
    "id": 4,
    "path": "/roles/foo3"
  }
]
```
