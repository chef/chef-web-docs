The syntax for using the **machine_image** resource in a recipe is as
follows:

``` ruby
machine_image 'name' do
  attribute 'value' # see properties section below
  ...
  action :action # see actions section below
end
```

where

-   `machine_image` tells Chef Infra Client to use the
    `Chef::Provider::MachineImage` provider during a Chef Infra Client
    run
-   `name` is the name of the resource block and also the name of the
    machine image
-   `attribute` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available
    for this resource
-   `action` identifies which steps Chef Infra Client will take to bring
    the node into the desired state
