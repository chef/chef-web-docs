Use the **windows_env** resource to manage environment keys in
Microsoft Windows. After an environment key is set, Microsoft Windows
must be restarted before the environment key will be available to the
Task Scheduler.

This resource was previously called the **env** resource; its name was
updated in Chef Client 14.0 to reflect the fact that only Windows is
supported. Existing cookbooks using `env` will continue to function, but
should be updated to use the new name.
