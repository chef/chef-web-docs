An `if` statement can be used to specify part of a recipe to be used
when certain conditions are met. `else` and `elseif` statements can be
used to handle situations where either the initial condition is not met
or when there are other possible conditions that can be met. Since this
behavior is 100% Ruby, do this in a recipe the same way here as anywhere
else.

For example, using an `if` statement with the `platform` node attribute:

``` ruby
if node['platform'] == 'ubuntu'
  # do ubuntu things
end
```
