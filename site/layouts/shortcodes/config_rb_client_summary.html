A client.rb file is used to specify the configuration details for Chef
Infra Client.

-   This file is loaded every time this executable is run
-   On UNIX- and Linux-based machines, the default location for this
    file is `/etc/chef/client.rb`; on Microsoft Windows machines, the
    default location for this file is `C:\chef\client.rb`; use the
    `--config` option from the command line to change this location
-   This file is not created by default
-   When a client.rb file is present in the default location, the
    settings contained within that client.rb file will override the
    default configuration settings
