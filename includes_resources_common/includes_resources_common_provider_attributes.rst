The |chef client| will determine the correct provider based on configuration data collected by |ohai| at the start of the |chef client| run. This configuration data is then mapped to a platform and an associated list of providers.

Generally, it's best to let the |chef client| choose the provider, and this is (by far) the most common approach. However, in some cases, specifying a provider may be desirable. There are two approaches:

* Use a more specific short name---``yum_package "foo" do`` instead of ``package "foo" do``, ``script "foo" do`` instead of ``bash "foo" do``, and so on---when available
* Use the ``provider`` property within the resource block to specify the long name of the provider as a property of a resource. For example: ``provider Chef::Provider::Long::Name``
