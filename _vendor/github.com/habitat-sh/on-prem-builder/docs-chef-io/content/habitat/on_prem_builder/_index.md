Chef Habitat On-Prem Builder is the preferred and fully supported method for hosting and managing Habitat packages within your organization's infrastructure.
It provides a secure, private, and compliant environment for managing your software artifacts and is ideal for both connected and air-gapped environments.

You can deploy Chef Habitat On-Prem Builder and privately host Chef Habitat packages and associated artifacts such as keys.
You can direct Chef Habitat clients (such as the `hab` cli, Supervisors, and Studios) to your On-Prem Builder deployment, which allows you to develop, execute, and manage packages without depending on the public Chef Habitat services.

## Audience

This documentation is for anyone who wishes to host Chef Habitat packages in their own infrastructure.

## Features

Once installed, you'll be able to do the following:

- Log into Chef Habitat On-Prem Builder.
- Create origins, keys, and access tokens.
- Invite users to origins.
- Upload and download Chef Habitat packages.
- Promote and demote Chef Habitat packages to channels.
- Normal interactions using the `hab` client with the Chef Habitat Builder API.
- Package builds using the `hab` client and Chef Habitat Studio.
- Import core packages from the upstream Chef Habitat SaaS Builder.
