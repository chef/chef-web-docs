## System Requirements

Minimum system requirements:

- RAM: 2GB
- Disk: 4GB
- Running minimum settings may limit your ability to take advantage of Chef Workstation tools such as Test Kitchen which creates and manages virtualized test environments.

Recommended system requirements:

- RAM: 4GB
- Disk 8GB

### Chef Workstation App Requirements

- Windows: No additional requirements
- Mac: No additional requirements
- Linux: You must have a graphical window manager running with support for system tray icons.
  - On some distributions you may need to install additional libraries. After you install the Chef Workstation package from the terminal, the post-install message will tell you which, if any, additional libraries are required to run the Chef Workstation App.

## Installation

The Chef Workstation installer must run as a privileged user.

Chef Workstation installs to `/opt/chef-workstation/` on macOS / Linux
and `C:\opscode\chef-workstation\` on Windows. These file locations
should help avoid interference between these components and other
applications that may be running on the target machine.

### macOS

1.  Dependency: Xcode is recommended for running Chef Workstation on
    macOS. While Chef Workstation works without Xcode, it is required
    for native Ruby Gem installation. Run `xcode-select --install` from
    the terminal to install Xcode.
2.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation#mac_os_x) and
    select the appropriate package for your macOS version. Click on the
    **Download** button.
3.  Follow the steps to accept the license and install Chef Workstation.

Alternately, install Chef Workstation using Homebrew:

`brew cask install chef-workstation`

### Windows

1.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation#windows) and select
    the appropriate package for your Windows version. Click on the
    **Download** button.
2.  Follow the steps to accept the license and install Chef Workstation.
    You will have the option to change your install location; by default
    the installer uses the `C:\opscode\chef-workstation\` directory.
3.  **Optional:** Set the default shell. On Microsoft Windows it is
    strongly recommended to use Windows PowerShell instead of `cmd.exe`.

#### Headless Unattended Install

"Headless" systems are configured to operate without a monitor (the "head") keyboard, and mouse.  They are usually controlled over a network connection.

To install Chef Workstation on a headless Windows system, exclude the Chef Workstation App from auto-starting on login by using the following command in Windows PowerShell or `cmd.exe`.  Replace `MsiPath` with the path of the downloaded Chef Workstation installer.

```
msiexec /q /i MsiPath ADDLOCAL=ALL REMOVE=ChefWSApp
```

### Linux

1.  Visit the [Chef Workstation downloads
    page](https://downloads.chef.io/products/workstation) and download the
    appropriate package for your distribution:

    ``` bash
    wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chef-workstation/20.11.180/ubuntu/20.04/chef-workstation_20.11.180-1_amd64.deb
    ```

2.  Use your distribution's package manager to install Chef Workstation:

    -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

        ``` bash
        rpm -Uvh chef-workstation-20.11.180-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
        ```

    -   Debian/Ubuntu:

        ``` bash
        dpkg -i chef-workstation_20.11.180-1_amd64.deb
        ```

## Verify the Installation

To verify the installation, run:

``` shell
chef -v
```

Which returns the versions of all installed Chef tools:

``` shell
Chef Workstation version: 20.11.180
Chef Infra Client version: 16.6.14
Chef InSpec version: 4.23.15
Chef CLI version: 3.0.33
Chef Habitat version: 1.6.56
Test Kitchen version: 2.7.2
Cookstyle version: 7.2.1
```

## Upgrading

### From Chef Workstation

For all platforms, follow the steps provided under [Installing]({{< ref "install_workstation.md" >}}).

### From ChefDK

#### Linux

The Chef Workstation package conflicts with an installed ChefDK package to prevent unintentional upgrades.

Prior to installing Chef Workstation, first uninstall ChefDK:

Ubuntu, Debian, and related:

```bash
sudo dpkg -P chefdk
```

Red Hat, CentOS, and related:

```bash
sudo rpm -e chefdk
```

#### Other

For other platforms, follow the steps provided under [Installing]({{< ref "#installing" >}}).

## Uninstalling

### Mac

Run ```uninstall_chef_workstation``` in your terminal.

### Windows

Use **Add / Remove Programs** to remove Chef Workstation.

### Linux

Ubuntu, Debian, and related:

```bash
sudo dpkg -P chef-workstation
```

Red Hat, CentOS, and related:

```bash
sudo rpm -e chef-workstation
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed Chef Workstation, proceed to the [Getting Started](/workstation/getting_started/) guide to configure your Chef Workstation installation.
