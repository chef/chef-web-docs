A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy
distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything that
is required to support that scenario:

-   Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which
    they are to be applied
-   Attribute values
-   File distributions
-   Templates
-   Extensions to Chef, such as custom resources and libraries
