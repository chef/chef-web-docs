## Upgrading to Chef Infra Server

Three upgrade scenarios exist for upgrades from Chef Infra Server 12.17.15 to Chef Infra Server 13 or 14:

- [Standalone](/upgrade_server/#standalone-upgrade)
- [Chef Backend (HA)](/upgrade_server/#chef-backend-upgrade)
- [Tiered](/upgrade_server/#tiered-upgrade)

### Chef Infra Server 14

{{< warning >}}

Do not upgrade your production server. First, upgrade in your test server, and then upgrade your production server.

{{< /warning >}}

Chef Infra Server 14 uses Elasticsearch as its search index.
{{% server_upgrade_duration %}}

The Chef Infra Server 14 upgrade does not reindex existing external Elasticsearch installations.

### Chef Infra Server 12.17.15 or Later

{{< warning >}}
Upgrade Chef Infra Server and any add-ons to compatible versions before setting `insecure_addon_compat` to `false`.
{{< /warning >}}

As of version 12.14, Chef Infra Server renders passwords inside of the `/etc/opscode` directory by default.
If you are using Chef Infra Server without add-ons, or if you are using the latest add-ons versions, you can set `insecure_addon_compat` to `false` in `/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb.
and Chef Infra Server will write all credentials to a single location.

For more information on password generation, including a list of supported add-on versions, see [Chef Infra Server Credentials Management](/server_security/#chef-infra-server-credentials-management).
