description: |-
  The node.set_unless method has been removed in Chef Infra Client 13 and usage must be replaced with node.normal_unless.

  This cop will autocorrect code to use node.normal_unless, which is functionally identical to node.set_unless, but we also discourage the use of that method as normal level attributes persist on the node even if the code setting the attribute is later removed.
