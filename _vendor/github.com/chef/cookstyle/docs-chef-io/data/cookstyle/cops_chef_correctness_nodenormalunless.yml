description: |-
  Normal attributes are discouraged since their semantics differ importantly from the
  default and override levels. Their values persist in the node object even after
  all code referencing them has been deleted, unlike default and override.

  Code should be updated to use default or override levels, but this will change
  attribute merging behavior so needs to be validated manually and force_default or
  force_override levels may need to be used in recipe code.
