department: Chef/Modernize
description: The allowed actions can now be specified using the `allowed_actions`
  helper instead of using the @actions or @allowed_actions variables in the resource's
  initialize method. In general we recommend against writing HWRPs, but if HWRPs are
  necessary you should utilize as much of the resource DSL as possible.
