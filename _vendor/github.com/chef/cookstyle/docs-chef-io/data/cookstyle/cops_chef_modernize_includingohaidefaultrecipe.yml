department: Chef/Modernize
description: The Ohai default recipe previously allowed a user to ship custom Ohai
  plugins to a system by including them in a directory in the Ohai cookbook. This
  functionality was replaced with the ohai_plugin resource, which should be used instead
  as it doesn't require forking the ohai cookbook.
