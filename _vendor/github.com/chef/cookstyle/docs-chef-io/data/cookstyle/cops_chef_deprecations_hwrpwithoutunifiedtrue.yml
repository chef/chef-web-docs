description: Chef Infra Client 15.3 and later include a new Unified Mode that simplies
  the execution of resoures by replace the traditional compile and converge phases
  with a single phase. Unified mode simplies writing advanced resources and avoids
  confusing errors that often occur when mixing ruby and Chef Infra resources. Chef
  Infra Client 17.0 and later will beging warning that `unified_mode true` should
  be set in all resources to validate that they will continue to function in Chef
  Infra Client 18.0 (April 2022) when Unified Mode becomes the default.
