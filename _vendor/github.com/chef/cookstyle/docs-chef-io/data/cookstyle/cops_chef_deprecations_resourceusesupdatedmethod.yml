description: Don't call the deprecated `updated=` method in a resource to set the
  resource to updated. This method was removed from Chef Infra Client 13 and this
  will now cause an error. Instead wrap code that updated the state of the node in
  a `converge_by` block. Documentation on using the `converge_by` block can be found
  at https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources/.
