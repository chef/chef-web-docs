  provider = Chef::Platform.provider_for_resource(resource, :create)

  resource = Chef::Resource::File.new("/tmp/foo.xyz", run_context)
  provider = Chef::Platform.find_provider("ubuntu", "16.04", resource)

  resource = Chef::Resource::File.new("/tmp/foo.xyz", run_context)
  provider = Chef::Platform.find_provider_for_node(node, resource)

  Chef::Platform.set :platform => :mac_os_x, :resource => :package, :provider => Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew
  ```

  resource = Chef::Resource::File.new("/tmp/foo.xyz", run_context)
  provider = resource.provider_for_action(:create)

  # provides :package, platform_family: 'mac_os_x'
