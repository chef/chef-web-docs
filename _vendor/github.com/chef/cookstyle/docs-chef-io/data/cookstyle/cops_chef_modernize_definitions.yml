description: In 2016 with Chef Infra Client 12.5 Custom Resources were introduced
  as a way of writing reusable resource code that could be shipped in cookbooks. Custom
  Resources offer many advantages of legacy Definitions including unit testing with
  ChefSpec, input validation, actions, common properties like not_if/only_if, and
  resource reporting.
