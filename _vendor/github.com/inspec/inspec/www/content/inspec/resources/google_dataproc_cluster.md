## Syntax

A `google_dataproc_cluster` is used to test a Google Cluster resource

## Beta Resource

This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_dataproc_cluster(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: 'europe-west2', cluster_name: 'inspec-dataproc-cluster') do
  it { should exist }
  its('labels') { should include('label' => 'value') }
  its('config.master_config.num_instances') { should cmp '1' }
  its('config.worker_config.num_instances') { should cmp '2' }
  its('config.master_config.machine_type_uri') { should match 'n1-standard-1' }
  its('config.worker_config.machine_type_uri') { should match 'n1-standard-1' }
  its('config.software_config.properties') { should include('dataproc:dataproc.allow.zero.workers' => 'true') }
end

describe google_dataproc_cluster(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: 'europe-west2', cluster_name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
