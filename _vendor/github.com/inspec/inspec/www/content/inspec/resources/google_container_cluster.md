## Syntax

A `google_container_cluster` is used to test a Google Cluster resource

## Beta Resource

This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'gcp-inspec-kube-cluster') do
  it { should exist }
  its('locations.sort'){ should cmp [ 'europe-west2-a', 'europe-west2-b', 'europe-west2-c' ].sort }

  its('master_auth.username') { should eq 'gcp-inspec-kube-admin' }
end

describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### Test that a GCP container cluster is in a particular state e.g. "RUNNING"

    describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'inspec-gcp-kube-cluster') do
      its('status') { should eq 'RUNNING' }
    end

### Test that a GCP container cluster has the expected kube master user/password

    describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'inspec-gcp-kube-cluster') do
      its('master_auth.username'){ should eq "user_name"}
      its('master_auth.password'){ should eq "choose_something_strong"}
    end

### Test that the locations where the GCP container cluster is running match those expected

    describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'inspec-gcp-kube-cluster') do
      its('locations.sort'){should cmp ["europe-west2-a", "europe-west2-b", "europe-west2-c"].sort}
    end

### Test GCP container cluster network and subnetwork settings

    describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'inspec-gcp-kube-cluster') do
      its('network'){should eq "default"}
      its('subnetwork'){should eq "default"}
    end

### Test GCP container cluster node pool configuration settings

    describe google_container_cluster(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', location: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'inspec-gcp-kube-cluster') do
      its('node_config.disk_size_gb'){should eq 100}
      its('node_config.image_type'){should eq "COS"}
      its('node_config.machine_type'){should eq "n1-standard-1"}

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_container_cluster` resource:

`name`
: The name of this cluster. The name must be unique within this project and location, and can be up to 40 characters. Must be Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must start with a letter. Must end with a number or a letter.

`description`
: An optional description of this cluster.

`initial_node_count`
: The number of nodes to create in this cluster. You must ensure that your Compute Engine resource quota is sufficient for this number of instances. You must also have available firewall and routes quota. For requests, this field should only be used in lieu of a "nodePool" object, since this configuration (along with the "nodeConfig") will be used to create a "NodePool" object with an auto-generated name. Do not use this and a nodePool at the same time. This field has been deprecated. Please use nodePool.initial_node_count instead.

`node_config`
: Parameters used in creating the cluster's nodes. For requests, this field should only be used in lieu of a "nodePool" object, since this configuration (along with the "initialNodeCount") will be used to create a "NodePool" object with an auto-generated name. Do not use this and a nodePool at the same time. For responses, this field will be populated with the node configuration of the first node pool. If unspecified, the defaults are used.

`machine_type`
: The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type (e.g. n1-standard-1). If unspecified, the default machine type is n1-standard-1.

`disk_size_gb`
: Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.

`oauth_scopes`
: The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the node VMs under the "default" service account. The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by default are not included: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting persistent storage on your nodes. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required for communicating with gcr.io (the Google Container Registry). If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will be added.

`service_account`
: The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node VMs. If no Service Account is specified, the "default" service account is used.

`metadata`
: The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster. Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than 128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env", "startup-script", and "user-data" Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32 KB. The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB. An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

`image_type`
: The image type to use for this node. Note that for a given image type, the latest version of it will be used.

`labels`
: The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to each node. These will added in addition to any default label(s) that Kubernetes may apply to the node. In case of conflict in label keys, the applied set may differ depending on the Kubernetes version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined and conflicts should be avoided. For more information, including usage and the valid values, see: http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/labels.html An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

`local_ssd_count`
: The number of local SSD disks to be attached to the node. The limit for this value is dependant upon the maximum number of disks available on a machine per zone. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#local_ssd_limits for more information.

`tags`
: The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by the client during cluster or node pool creation. Each tag within the list must comply with RFC1035.

`preemptible`
: Whether the nodes are created as preemptible VM instances. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible for more information about preemptible VM instances.

`accelerators`
: A list of hardware accelerators to be attached to each node. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus for more information about support for GPUs.
