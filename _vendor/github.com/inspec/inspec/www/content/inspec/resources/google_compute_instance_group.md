## Syntax

A `google_compute_instance_group` is used to test a Google InstanceGroup resource

## Beta Resource

This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples

```ruby

describe google_compute_instance_group(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', zone: 'zone', name: 'inspec-instance-group') do
  it { should exist }
  its('description') { should cmp 'My instance group for testing' }
  its('named_ports.count') { should cmp 1 }
  its('named_ports.first.name') { should cmp 'https' }
  its('named_ports.first.port') { should cmp '8080' }
end

describe google_compute_instance_group(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', zone: 'zone', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### Test that a GCP compute instance group has the expected size

    describe google_compute_instance_group(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', zone: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'gcp-inspec-test') do
      its('size') { should eq 2 }
    end

### Test that a GCP compute instance group has a port with supplied name and value

    describe google_compute_instance_group(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp', zone: 'europe-west2-a', name: 'gcp-inspec-test') do
      its('port_name') { should eq "http" }
      its('port_value') { should eq 80 }
    end

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_instance_group` resource:

`creation_timestamp`
: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

`description`
: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

`id`
: A unique identifier for this instance group.

`name`
: The name of the instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.

`named_ports`
: Assigns a name to a port number. For example: {name: "http", port: 80}. This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple ports. For example: [{name: "http", port: 80},{name: "http", port: 8080}] Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.

  `name`
  : The name for this named port. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.

  `port`
  : The port number, which can be a value between 1 and 65535.

`network`
: The network to which all instances in the instance group belong.

`region`
: The region where the instance group is located (for regional resources).

`subnetwork`
: The subnetwork to which all instances in the instance group belong.

`zone`
: A reference to the zone where the instance group resides.
