## Syntax

A `google_pubsub_subscription` is used to test a Google Subscription resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_pubsub_subscription(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'inspec-gcp-subscription') do
  it { should exist }
end

describe google_pubsub_subscription(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_pubsub_subscription` resource:

`name`
: Name of the subscription.

`topic`
: A reference to a Topic resource.

`labels`
: A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.

`push_config`
: If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.

  `oidc_token`
  : If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.

    `service_account_email`
    : Service account email to be used for generating the OIDC token. The caller (for subscriptions.create, subscriptions.patch, and subscriptions.modifyPushConfig RPCs) must have the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.

    `audience`
    : Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.

  `push_endpoint`
  : A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For example, a Webhook endpoint might use "https://example.com/push".

  `attributes`
  : Endpoint configuration attributes.  Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.  The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.  If not present during the subscriptions.create call, it will default to the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute.  The possible values for this attribute are:  - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

`ack_deadline_seconds`
: This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.

`message_retention_duration`
: How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`). A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: `"600.5s"`.

`retain_acked_messages`
: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the messageRetentionDuration window.

`expiration_policy`
: A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. If it is set but ttl is "", the resource never expires. The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl is 1 day.

  `ttl`
  : Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl. If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example - "3.5s".

`dead_letter_policy`
: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is disabled. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.

  `dead_letter_topic`
  : The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.  The Cloud Pub/Sub service\naccount associated with the enclosing subscription's parent project (i.e.,  service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Publish() to this topic.  The operation will fail if the topic does not exist. Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.

  `max_delivery_attempts`
  : The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be between 5 and 100.  The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of  NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).  A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.  This field will be honored on a best effort basis.  If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.

## GCP Permissions

Ensure the [Cloud Pub/Sub API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/pubsub.googleapis.com/) is enabled for the current project.
