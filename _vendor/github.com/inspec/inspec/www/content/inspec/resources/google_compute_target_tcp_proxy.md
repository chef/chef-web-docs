## Syntax

A `google_compute_target_tcp_proxy` is used to test a Google TargetTcpProxy resource

## Beta Resource

This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_compute_target_tcp_proxy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'inspec-gcp-target-tcp-proxy') do
  it { should exist }
  its('proxy_header') { should eq 'NONE' }
  its('service') { should  match /\/gcp-inspec-tcp-backend-service$/ }
end

describe google_compute_target_tcp_proxy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties
