## Syntax

A `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy` is used to test a Google Subscription Iam Policy resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy(project: "project", name: "name") do
  it { should exist }
end

google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy(project: "project", name: "name").bindings.each do |binding|
  describe binding do
    its('role') { should eq 'roles/editor'}
    its('members') { should include 'user:testuser@example.com'}
  end
end
```
