Use the `aws_ecs_cluster` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS ECS Cluster.

## Syntax

An `aws_ecs_cluster` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS ECS Cluster by cluster name.

    describe aws_ecs_cluser(cluster_name: 'cluster-8') do
      it             { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

If no parameters are passed, the resource will attempt to retrieve the `default` ECS Cluster.

### cluster_name _(optional)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the Cluster Name.
This can be passed either as a string or as a `cluster_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on ECS Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_clusters.html).

## Examples

### Test that an ECS Cluster does not exist

    describe aws_ecs_cluster(cluster_name: 'invalid-cluster') do
      it    { should_not exist }
    end

### Test that an ECS Cluster is active

    describe aws_ecs_cluster('cluster-8') do
      its ('status') { should eq 'ACTIVE' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](/inspec/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_ecs_cluster('cluster-8') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_ecs_cluster('cluster-9') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal)
will need the `ec2:DescribeClusters` action set to allow.
