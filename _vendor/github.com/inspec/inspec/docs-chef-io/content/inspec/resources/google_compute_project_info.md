## Syntax

A `google_compute_project_info` is used to test a Google ProjectInfo resource

## Beta Resource

This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples

```
describe google_compute_project_info(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec') do
  it { should exist }
  its('default_service_account') { should match "developer.gserviceaccount.com" }
end
```

### Test that GCP compute project information exists

    describe google_compute_project_info(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### Test that GCP compute project default service account is as expected

    describe google_compute_project_info(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp') do
      its('default_service_account') { should eq '12345-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com' }
    end
