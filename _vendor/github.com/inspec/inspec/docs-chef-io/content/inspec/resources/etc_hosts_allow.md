Use the `etc_hosts_allow` Chef InSpec audit resource to test rules defined for accepting daemon and client traffic in the `'/etc/hosts.allow'` file.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.39.1 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An etc/hosts.allow rule specifies one or more daemons mapped to one or more clients, with zero or more options to for accepting traffic when found.

Use the where clause to match a property to one or more rules in the hosts.allow file.

    describe etc_hosts_allow.where { daemon == 'value' } do
      its ('client_list') { should include ['values'] }
      its ('options') { should include ['values'] }
    end

Use the optional constructor parameter to give an alternative path to hosts.allow

    describe etc_hosts_allow(hosts_path).where { daemon == 'value' } do
      its ('client_list') { should include ['values'] }
      its ('options') { should include ['values'] }
    end

where

- `daemon` is a daemon that will be allowed to pass traffic in.
- `client_list` is a list of clients will be allowed to pass traffic in.
- `options` is a list of tasks that to be done with the rule when traffic is found.

## Properties

- `daemon`
- `client_list`
- `options`

    end

### client_list

`client_list` returns a 2d string array where each entry contains the clients specified for the rule.

    end
