Use the `aws_iam_access_keys` InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS IAM Access Keys.

## Syntax

An `aws_iam_access_keys` resource block returns all IAM Access Keys and allows the testing of that group of Access Keys.

      describe aws_iam_access_keys do
        it                    { should exist }
        its('access_key_ids') { should include 'AKIA1111111111111111' }
      end

## Parameters

This resources accepts a single optional parameter, a Username for which to retrieve all Access Keys.
If not provided, all Access Keys for all Users will be retrieved.

### username _(optional)_

The IAM Username for which to retrieve the Access Keys.
This can be passed either as a string or as a `username: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.
