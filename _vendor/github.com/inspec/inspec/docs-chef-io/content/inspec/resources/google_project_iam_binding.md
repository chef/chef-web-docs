## Syntax

A `google_project_iam_binding` is used to test a Google Project Iam Bindings

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_project_iam_binding(project: "project", role: "roles/editor") do
  it { should exist }
  its('members') { should include 'user:testuser@example.com' }
end
```

This resource supports [IAM conditions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview). Specifying a `condition` in the constructor matches only bindings with that condition. `condition` has three possible fields, `title`, `expression` and `description`. If any of these fields are unspecified they will not be matched.

```
describe google_project_iam_binding(project: "project", role: "roles/browser", condition: { title: "my title" }) do
  it { should exist }
  its('members.count'){ should cmp 1 }
  its('members') { should include 'user:testuser@example.com' }
  its('condition.title') {should cmp 'my title' }
  its('condition.expression') { should cmp "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')" }
end
```
