## Syntax

A `google_storage_bucket_acl` is used to test a Google BucketACL resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_storage_bucket_acl(bucket: 'storage-bucket-name', entity: user-email) do
  it { should exist }
  its('role') { should cmp "OWNER" }

  its('bucket') { should eq 'storage-bucket-name' }
  its('email') { should include entity-email.com }
end

describe google_storage_bucket_acl(bucket: 'storage-bucket-name', entity: "allUsers") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
