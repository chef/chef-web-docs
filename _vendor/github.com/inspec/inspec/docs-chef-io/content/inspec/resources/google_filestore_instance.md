  its('file_shares.count') { should cmp 1 }
  its('file_shares.first.capacity_gb') { should cmp '2660' }
  its('file_shares.first.name') { should cmp 'inspecgcp' }
  its('networks.count') { should cmp 1 }
  its('networks.first.network') { should cmp 'default' }
  its('networks.first.modes') { should include 'MODE_IPV4' }
