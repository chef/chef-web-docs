Use the `aws_kms_keys` InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS KMS Keys.

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes creating and
controlling your encryption keys for your data easier. KMS uses Hardware Security
Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys.

AWS Key Management Service is integrated with several other AWS services to help
you protect the data you store with these services.

## Syntax

An `aws_kms_keys` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of KMS Keys and then tests that group.

    # Verify the number of KMS keys in the AWS account
    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('entries.count') { should cmp 10 }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on KS Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| key_ids  | The IDs of the returned keys.                                                                |
| key_arns | The Amazon Resource Names of the returned keys.                                              |
| entries  | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Ensure a Key exists

    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('key_ids') { should include 'fd7e608b-f435-4186-b8b5-111111111111'}
    end

### Allow at most 100 KMS Keys on the account

    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('entries.count') { should be <= 100}
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](/inspec/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_kms_keys do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_kms_keys.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `kms:ListKeys` action with Effect set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awskeymanagementservice.html).
