## Syntax

A `google_storage_bucket` is used to test a Google Bucket resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_storage_bucket(name: bucket-name) do
  it { should exist }
  its('location') { should cmp 'europe-west2'.upcase }

  its('storage_class') { should eq "STANDARD" }
  its('labels') { should include("key" => "value") }
  its('retention_policy.retention_period') { should cmp 1000 }
end

describe google_storage_bucket(name: "nonexistent") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### Test that a GCP storage bucket is in the expected location

    describe google_storage_bucket(name: 'chef-inspec-gcp-storage-bucket-abcd') do
      its('location') { should eq "EUROPE-WEST2" }
    end

### Test that a GCP storage bucket has the expected project number

    describe google_storage_bucket(name: 'chef-inspec-gcp-storage-bucket-abcd') do
      its('project_number') {should eq 12345678 }
    end

### Test that a GCP storage bucket has the expected storage class

    describe google_storage_bucket(name: 'chef-inspec-gcp-storage-bucket-abcd') do
      its('storage_class') { should eq 'STANDARD' }
    end

  `main_page_suffix`
