## Syntax

A `google_project_iam_policy` is used to test a Google Project Iam Policy resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_project_iam_policy(project: "project") do
  it { should exist }
end

google_project_iam_policy(project: "project").bindings.each do |binding|
  describe binding do
    its('role') { should eq 'roles/editor'}
    its('members') { should include 'user:testuser@example.com'}
  end
end
```

This resource supports [IAM conditions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview).
