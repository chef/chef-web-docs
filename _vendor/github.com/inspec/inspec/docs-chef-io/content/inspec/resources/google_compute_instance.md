## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_instance` resource:

`can_ip_forward`
: Allows this instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IPs. This is required if you plan to use this instance to forward routes.

`cpu_platform`
: The CPU platform used by this instance.

`creation_timestamp`
: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

`deletion_protection`
: Whether the resource should be protected against deletion.

`disks`
: An array of disks that are associated with the instances that are created from this template.

  `auto_delete`
  : Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance).  Tip: Disks should be set to autoDelete=true so that leftover disks are not left behind on machine deletion.

  `boot`
  : Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.

  `device_name`
  : Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.

  `disk_encryption_key`
  : Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.

    `raw_key`
    : Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.

    `rsa_encrypted_key`
    : Specifies an RFC 4648 base64 encoded, RSA-wrapped 2048-bit customer-supplied encryption key to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.

    `sha256`
    : The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied encryption key that protects this resource.

  `index`
  : Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for the boot disk. For example, if you have many disks attached to an instance, each disk would have a unique index number. If not specified, the server will choose an appropriate value.

  `initialize_params`
  : Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new instance.

    `disk_name`
    : Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name of the instance.

    `disk_size_gb`
    : Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.

    `disk_type`
    : Reference to a disk type. Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance. If not specified, the default is pd-standard.

    `source_image`
    : The source image to create this disk. When creating a new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required.  To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name.

    `source_image_encryption_key`
    : The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.  Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot create disks for instances in a managed instance group if the source images are encrypted with your own keys.

  `interface`
  : Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format than SCSI.

    Possible values:
    - SCSI
    - NVME

  `mode`
  : The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.

    Possible values:
    - READ_WRITE
    - READ_ONLY

  `source`
  : Reference to a disk. When creating a new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required.  If desired, you can also attach existing non-root persistent disks using this property. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

`network_interfaces`
: An array of configurations for this interface. This specifies how this interface is configured to interact with other network services, such as connecting to the internet. Only one network interface is supported per instance.

    `access_configs`

      `network_tier`
      : This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration. If an AccessConfig is specified without a valid external IP address, an ephemeral IP will be created with this networkTier. If an AccessConfig with a valid external IP address is specified, it must match that of the networkTier associated with the Address resource owning that IP.
      
        Possible values:
        - PREMIUM
        - STANDARD

    `alias_ip_ranges`
    : An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. Can only be specified for network interfaces on subnet-mode networks.

      : The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address (e.g. 10.2.3.4), a netmask (e.g. /24) or a CIDR format string (e.g. 10.1.2.0/24).

      `subnetwork_range_name`
      : Optional subnetwork secondary range name specifying the secondary range from which to allocate the IP CIDR range for this alias IP range. If left unspecified, the primary range of the subnetwork will be used.

    : An IPv4 internal network address to assign to the instance for this network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP is assigned by the system.

    `subnetwork`
    : Reference to a VPC network. If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property.  If the network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field should be specified.

`scheduling`
: Sets the scheduling options for this instance.

    `automatic_restart`
    : Specifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances cannot be automatically restarted.

  - STOPPING
  - SUSPENDING
  - SUSPENDED
  - TERMINATED

`status_message`
: An optional, human-readable explanation of the status.

`tags`
: A list of tags to apply to this instance. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by the client during instance creation. The tags can be later modified by the setTags method. Each tag within the list must comply with RFC1035.

  `fingerprint`
  : Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.
