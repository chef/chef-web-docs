## Syntax

A `google_project_iam_custom_role` is used to test a Google CustomRole resource

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_project_iam_custom_role(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'admin-role') do
  it { should exist }
  its('stage') { should eq 'GA' }
  its('included_permissions') { should eq ["iam.roles.list"] }
end

describe google_project_iam_custom_role(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
