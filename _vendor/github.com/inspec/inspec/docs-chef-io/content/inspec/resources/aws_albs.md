## Examples

### Test that an ALB has its availability zones configured correctly

    describe aws_alb('arn::alb') do
      its('zone_names.count')  { should be > 1 }
      its('zone_names')        { should include 'us-east-2a' }
      its('zone_names')        { should include 'us-east-2b' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has no special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](/inspec/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_albs do
      it                             { should exist }
      its('availability_zones')      { should_not include 'us-east-1a'}
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers` action set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Authentication and Access Control for Your Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/load-balancer-authentication-access-control.html)
