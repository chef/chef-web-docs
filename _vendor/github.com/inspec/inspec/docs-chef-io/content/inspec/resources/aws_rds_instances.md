Use the `aws_rds_instances` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a collection of AWS RDS instances.

RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server.

RDS instances are compute instances used by the RDS service.

## Syntax

Ensure you have exactly 3 instances

    describe aws_rds_instances do
      its('db_instance_identifiers.count') { should cmp 3 }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/?id=docs_gateway).

## Properties

| Property                | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| db_instance_identifiers | The unique IDs of the RDS Instances returned.                                                |
| entries                 | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |

## Examples

### Ensure a specific instance exists

    describe aws_rds_instances do
      its('db_instance_identifiers') { should include 'rds-12345678' }
    end

### Test That All Rds Instances Are Encrypted by Id

Use the InSpec resource to request the IDs of all RDS instances, then test in-depth
using `aws_rds_instance` to ensure all instances are encrypted and have a sensible size.

    aws_rds_instances.db_instance_identifiers.each do |db_instance_identifier|
      describe aws_rds_instance(db_instance_identifier) do
        it { should be_encrypted }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](/inspec/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_rds_instances do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_rds_instances do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `ec2:DescribeInstances`, and `iam:GetInstanceProfile` actions set to allow.
