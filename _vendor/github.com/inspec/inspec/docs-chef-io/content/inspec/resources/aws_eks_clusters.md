## Examples

### Allow at most 100 EKS Clusters on the account

    describe aws_eks_clusters do
      its('entries.count') { should be <= 100}
    end

### Ensure a specific Cluster exists, by name

    describe aws_eks_clusters do
      its('names') { should include('cluster-1') }
    end

### Ensure no Clusters are in a failed state

    describe aws_eks_clusters.where( failed: true ) do
        it { should_not exist )
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list
of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](/inspec/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_eks_clusters.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_eks_clusters.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `eks:DescribeCluster` action with Effect set to Allow.

The documentation for EKS actions is at [Policy Structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-policy-structure.html#UsingWithEKS_Actions)
