## What are Chef InSpec Plugins?

Chef InSpec Plugins are optional software components that extend the capabilities
of InSpec. For example, [`inspec-iggy`](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-iggy)
is a Plugin project that aims to generate Chef InSpec controls from
infrastructure-as-code files. Plugins are distributed as RubyGems, and Chef InSpec
manages their installation. Chef InSpec Plugins always begin with the prefix
'inspec-'.

## What are Train Plugins?

Train Plugins allow Chef InSpec to speak to new kinds of targets (typically new
remote targets or APIs, but you could treat the local system in a new way if you
wished to). For example, if you wanted to audit a Kubernetes cluster, you might
want a transport that can talk to the supervisor API. You would develop a Train
Plugin for that, and install it using the Chef InSpec command line. Train Plugins
always begin with the prefix 'train-'.

## What can plugins do?

Currently, each plugin can offer one or more of these capabilities:

- define new output formats ("reporters")
- input sources
- define a new command-line-interface (CLI) command suite (`inspec` plugins)
- connectivity to new types of hosts or cloud providers (`train` plugins)
- DSL extensions at the file, control, describe block, or test level
- DSL extensions for custom resources

## How do I find out which plugins are available?

The Chef InSpec CLI can tell you which plugins are available:

```bash
inspec plugin search inspec-
```

## How do I install and manage plugins?

The Chef InSpec command line now offers a new subcommand just for managing plugins.

You can install a plugin by running:

```bash
inspec plugin install inspec-some-plugin
inspec plugin install train-some-plugin
```

For more details on what the `plugin` command can do, run `inspec plugin help`.

## How do I use a different Gem server?

You can specify an alternate source by passing the base of your Gem repository to
the `--source` parameter:

```bash
inspec plugin search --source https://my.private.server inspec-private
inspec plugin install --source https://my.private.server inspec-private-plugin
```
