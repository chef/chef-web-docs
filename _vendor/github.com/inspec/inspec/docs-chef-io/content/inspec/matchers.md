Chef InSpec uses matchers to help compare resource values to expectations.
The following matchers are available:

You may also use any matcher provided by [RSpec::Expectations](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs),
but those matchers are outside of InSpec's [scope of support](/inspec/inspec_and_friends/#rspec).

The following InSpec-supported universal matchers are available:

- [`be`](#be) - make numeric comparisons
- [`be_in`](#be_in) - look for the property value in a list
- [`cmp`](#cmp) - general-use equality (try this first)
- [`eq`](#eq) - type-specific equality
- [`include`](#include) - look for an expected value in a list-valued property
- [`match`](#match) - look for patterns in text using regular expressions

See [Explore Chef InSpec resources](https://learn.chef.io/modules/explore-inspec-resources#/)
on Learn Chef Rally to learn more about InSpec's built-in matchers.

## be

This matcher can be followed by many different comparison operators.
Always make sure to use numbers, not strings, for these comparisons.

```ruby
describe file('/proc/cpuinfo') do
  its('size') { should be >= 10 }
  its('size') { should be < 1000 }
end
```

## cmp

Unlike `eq`, `cmp` is a matcher for less-restrictive comparisons. It will
try to fit the actual value to the type you are comparing it to. This is
meant to relieve the user from having to write type-casts and
resolutions.

```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  its('Protocol') { should cmp 2 }
end

describe passwd.uid(0) do
  its('users') { should cmp 'root' }
end
```

`cmp` behaves in the following way:

* Compare strings to numbers

```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  # Only `'2'` works
  its('Protocol') { should eq '2' }

  # Both of these work
  its('Protocol') { should cmp '2' }
  its('Protocol') { should cmp 2 }
end
```

* String comparisons are not case-sensitive

```ruby
describe auditd_conf do
  its('log_format') { should cmp 'raw' }
  its('log_format') { should cmp 'RAW' }
end
```

* Recognize versions embedded in strings

```ruby
describe package('curl') do
  its('version') { should cmp > '7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10' }
end
```

* Compare arrays with only one entry to a value

```ruby
describe passwd.uids(0) do
  its('users') { should cmp 'root' }
  its('users') { should cmp ['root'] }
end
```

* Single-value arrays of strings may also be compared to a regex

```ruby
describe auditd_conf do
  its('log_format') { should cmp /raw/i }
end
```

* Improved printing of octal comparisons

```ruby
describe file('/proc/cpuinfo') do
  its('mode') { should cmp '0345' }
end

expected: 0345
got: 0444
```

## eq

Test for exact equality of two values.

```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  its('RSAAuthentication') { should_not eq 'no' }
  its('Protocol') { should eq '2' }
end
```

`eq` fails if types don't match. Please keep this in mind, when comparing
configuration entries that are numbers:

```ruby
its('Port') { should eq '22' } # ok

its('Port') { should eq 22 }
# fails: '2' != 2 (string vs int)
```

For less restrictive comparisons, please use `cmp`.

## include

Verifies if a value is included in a list.

```ruby
describe passwd do
  its('users') { should include 'my_user' }
end
```

## be_in

Verifies that an item is included in a list.

```ruby
describe resource do
  its('item') { should be_in LIST }
end
```

## match

Check if a string matches a regular expression.

```ruby
describe sshd_config do
  its('Ciphers') { should_not match /cbc/ }
end
```
